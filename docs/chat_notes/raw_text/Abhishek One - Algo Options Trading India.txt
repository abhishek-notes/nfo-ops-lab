Abhishek One - Algo Options Trading India
Find all the numbers related to options trading in India 
and how they have changed over the last 2-3 years. I 
assume that the numbers have gone down after the 
initial trend, especially in the Bank Nifty index.
I also want to know the volume, quantity, and the 
amount actually being invested by retail participants 
and by institutions, so I can see the diﬀerences and 
understand how things have been progressing. 
Please be comprehensive and include all the details I 
might need as I explore algo options trading for the 
Indian market. 
To help you thoroughly with this, could you please clarify the following:
1. Are you interested in data only from NSE (National Stock Exchange) or from
other Indian exchanges as well?
2. Should I focus only on index options (like Bank Nifty, Nifty 50) or also include
stock options?
3. Are you looking for monthly/quarterly/yearly data, and from which speciﬁc year
(e.g., starting 2021)?
4. Do you want this data broken down by participant category (retail vs institutions
like FPIs, DIIs, proprietary ﬁrms)?
5. Should I include insights on regulations, margin changes, or structural reforms
(e.g., weekly expiry shifts, SEBI regulations) that could have aﬀected volumes?
This will help ensure the report is detailed and tailored to your goals in algo options
trading in India.
Both NSE and BSE should be included, along with stock 
options.
I'm looking for a quarterly chart. I want the data to be 
broken down by participant category: retail, high-net-
worth individuals, institutions, and proprietary ﬁrms.
1/22

Please include insights on regulations as well. 
Got it. I will gather detailed quarterly data from both NSE and BSE for the past 2–3
years covering index and stock options. The breakdown will include volumes,
quantity, and investment value by retail participants, HNIs, institutions, and
proprietary ﬁrms. I’ll also include insights on key regulatory changes and structural
reforms that have impacted options trading in India during this period.
I’ll notify you once the report is ready.
Options Trading Trends and Participant Analysis in India (Past 3 Years)
Options Trading in India (2022–2025): Volumes,
Participants, and Regulatory Changes
Explosive Growth and Recent Decline in Volumes

via Reuters)
Over the past few years, India’s equity options trading volume surged to
unprecedented levels, making India the world’s largest equity derivatives market
by 2023-24 . For instance, in Q2 2024 over 36.8 billion equity index
option contracts were traded on NSE and BSE combined – more than double the
volume of Q2 2023 . Notional turnover skyrocketed as well: by early 2024,
monthly F&O turnover in India had increased roughly six-fold since early 2022 .
According to Bloomberg/SEBI data, total F&O turnover hit record highs in 2023,
peaking around late 2023 to early 2024 【 26† 】 . Much of this boom was driven by
Bank Nifty and Nifty index options, especially short-term weekly expiries
introduced in 2019, which fueled speculative frenzy among retail traders .
By February 2024, the notional turnover in India’s equity derivatives market
reached about $6 trillion in a month (a six-fold jump from 2022 levels) before easing
oﬀ slightly .

3/22

Starting late 2024, however, volumes began to pull back due to regulatory curbs
(detailed later). By December 2024, trading activity had visibly cooled from its peak –
the average daily notional turnover fell to ₹280 trillion in Dec 2024 (down 37%
month-on-month from ₹442T in Nov) , marking the lowest level since
mid-2023. Index options volume (especially Bank Nifty weekly contracts) saw a steep
drop after new rules: one brokerage CEO noted a 72% plunge in index option
volumes from Dec 2024 to June 2025 following the discontinuation of weekly index
expiries . By early 2025, premium turnover (the actual rupee value paid
for options) was down ~9% year-on-year, yet still 14% higher than two years prior –
indicating volumes remain high relative to 2021–22 . In fact, even
after recent declines, index option turnover in early 2025 was nearly double (+99%
in notional terms) what it was two years ago . India continues to
lead globally in derivatives trading, though growth has moderated
. Regulators note that trading levels are still signiﬁcantly higher than two years
ago despite the pullback .
Retail vs. Institutional Participation Trends
4/22

Retail (Individual) traders have become dominant players in India’s options market
in the last 2–3 years. SEBI data show that the retail share of derivative trading
volume jumped from just 2% in 2018 to around 41% by 2023 . By early 2024,
roughly one-third of index option turnover was driven by retail investors .
The number of individuals actively trading F&O also exploded: from about 42.7 lakh
(4.27 million) in FY2021-22 to 58.4 lakh in FY22-23, then to 86.3 lakh in FY23-24
. Even FY2024-25 saw a further 11% rise in participation to
~96 lakh individuals . This retail inﬂux – consisting of both small traders
and high-net-worth individuals (HNIs) – was fueled by easy app-based trading,
pandemic-era free time, and the allure of quick proﬁts with low upfront capital
(options premiums can cost just a few rupees) .
However, most retail traders faced losses. Studies revealed about 90–93% of
individual F&O traders incurred net losses, with collective losses mounting each
year . In FY2024-25, retail traders’ net losses widened 41%
YoY to ₹1.06 lakh crore (trillion) . Despite this, retail enthusiasm
persisted through 2023. It was only after late-2024 regulatory tightening that retail
activity tempered. Between Dec 2024 and March 2025, the number of active
individual traders fell ~12% YoY (though still +77% vs two years prior)
. In the 6 months post-curbs (Dec 2024–May 2025), average daily
turnover by individuals dropped 11% YoY , and the count of active retail
traders dropped 20% YoY . Quarter-by-quarter data from SEBI’s FY25
study shows a clear inﬂection: retail trader count plunged from ~61.4 lakh in Q1
FY25 to 42.7 lakh in Q4 FY25 after the new rules . In that same period,
individual traders’ daily turnover fell to ₹56,000 crore from ~₹62,700 crore a year
earlier . Retail index options volumes in late 2024 were about 5% lower
(in premium terms) than the prior year, but still 34% higher than two years before
. In short, the initial retail frenzy has cooled somewhat since late
2024, but retail participation and volumes remain well above pre-2021 levels.
5/22

High-Net-Worth Individuals (HNIs) vs Small Retail: Within the broad retail category,
activity is heavily skewed toward a small subset of aggressive traders. SEBI noted
that 25% of individual traders account for 95% of options premium turnover
 – meaning the bulk of volume comes from higher-net-worth or
very active retail traders. When new rules kicked in, smaller retail traders scaled
back the most: participation by individuals with <₹10 lakh capital dropped ~25%,
whereas the decline for higher-volume (presumably HNI) traders was only ~7%
. In eﬀect, casual dabblers have retreated post-curbs, while
wealthier or more active individuals continue to trade (and still drive most of the
volume).
Institutional and Proprietary players: Despite the retail boom, proprietary trading
ﬁrms and brokers’ own desks remain the single largest segment in India’s options
market. In 2023, prop trading (including market-makers and HFT ﬁrms) comprised
roughly 50–60% of total equity derivative turnover . Even Zerodha’s
CEO Nithin Kamath noted that prop trading ﬁrms (e.g. Jane Street) accounted for
~50% of options volumes, versus ~35% by retail . Foreign
Portfolio Investors (FPIs) and domestic institutions (mutual funds, banks, insurance,
etc.) play only a minor role in equity F&O. Exchange data indicate FPIs contribute
only about 3–8% of derivatives turnover , and domestic institutional
trades are in the single digits percentage-wise. (Indian mutual funds primarily invest
in cash equities and use derivatives sparingly for hedging). In fact, as of early 2024,
NSE data showed one-half of index options turnover was from proprietary traders,
one-third from retail, and less than one-tenth from foreign investors . This
mix has remained relatively stable, though if retail pullback continues, the balance
may tilt back slightly toward institutional/pro players. Notably, the crackdown on a
large prop player (Jane Street) in 2024 had observers watching for any volume
impact – but industry experts believe India’s market is structural and not dependent
on any single ﬁrm, expecting others to step in if one exits .
NSE vs BSE, and Index vs Stock Options
6/22

The National Stock Exchange (NSE) overwhelmingly dominates India’s options
trading, though the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) has made some inroads. NSE’s
equity derivatives segment accounts for the vast majority of volume – for example,
most of the ₹9,504 trillion notional monthly turnover (world’s highest) recorded in
May 2023 occurred on NSE . BSE’s F&O market was negligible a few years
ago but has grown after launching weekly index options on the Sensex and Bankex.
By mid-2024, BSE’s derivative turnover rose from near zero to roughly ₹2,000 trillion
(notional) per month, although NSE still handled about 3–4 times more (~₹6,000–
7,000 trillion)【 28† 】 . In FY2025, BSE was projected to derive ~58% of its revenues
from the derivatives segment as it tries to capture more volume . Still,
NSE’s Nifty index options remain the most traded contracts by far.
In terms of products, index options (on Nifty, Bank Nifty, FinNifty, etc.) have eclipsed
single-stock options in India. Unlike the US, where stock options on individual
companies are huge, India’s derivatives boom has been centered on index contracts.
The Indian market historically favored single-stock futures for betting on individual
stocks, while stock options saw comparatively lower volumes . As a result,
index options now constitute the lion’s share of the options market. In March 2024,
for example, out of ₹12.5 trillion in total options premiums traded on NSE, ₹11.3
trillion (~90%) came from index options . Stock options were only ~10%
of the market by value. Moreover, recent margin and lot size increases for stock
F&O have made stock options less attractive to retail speculators, nudging them
toward index instruments . Industry observers noted that stricter
regulation of stock futures/options in 2022–23 led many traders to shift into index
option strategies instead . Thus, while stock options are traded
(especially on large-cap stocks), their volumes have not grown as explosively as
Nifty/BankNifty options, and many retail traders now prefer indices for their
liquidity and lower per-unit price.
Regulatory Changes and Their Impact
Indian regulators grew concerned by the rapid F&O growth and high retail losses,
and from 2023 onward SEBI enacted a series of measures to temper speculative
excess. Notable regulatory changes in the last 2–3 years include:
7/22

Limiting Weekly Expiries: Starting late 2023, SEBI restricted weekly index option
contracts to “one expiry per exchange.” In practice, NSE was allowed to oﬀer
weekly expiry on one index (Nifty 50), and BSE on one index (Sensex). Popular
mid-week expiries like Bank Nifty (Wed) and FinNifty (Tue) weekly options were
discontinued . This was a major shift since weekly
options had been a key driver of volume. The change, implemented around Nov
2024, immediately curbed short-term speculative trading – evidenced by a sharp
drop in index option volumes (~72% as noted above) and a migration of some
activity to monthly contracts . (As of mid-2025, SEBI has even
considered reducing expiries further – e.g. a fortnightly expiry cycle – if volumes
remain too high, though no decision has been ﬁnalized)
.
Larger Contract Sizes: To ensure only adequately capitalized traders participate,
SEBI increased the lot size (contract value) of index derivatives eﬀective early
2024. The minimum contract value was raised from roughly ₹5–10 lakh to ₹15–
20 lakh . For example, the lot size for Nifty and Bank Nifty
futures/options was increased so that one contract now represents a higher
notional value. This makes trading more expensive for small players, thereby
discouraging excessive leverage. The higher lot sizes took eﬀect gradually (ﬁrst
applied to new weekly contracts in Jan 2024)  and contributed to the
decline in total number of contracts traded (even if notional turnover remained
high).
Higher Margin & Risk Controls: SEBI introduced stricter margin requirements
and risk management rules, particularly around expiry days. Additional “expiry
day margins” (Extreme Loss Margins) were mandated for short option
positions , making intraday speculative shorting costlier. In May 2025,
SEBI also changed open interest calculations to a “future-equivalent” basis
(instead of notional) to better cap excessive exposure . These
steps, combined with earlier peak margin regulations (fully implemented by
2021), ensure traders put up more upfront capital, reducing leverage-fueled
speculation.
8/22

Position Limits Linked to Underlying: To prevent market manipulation (a
concern underscored by the Jane Street episode in Bank Nifty), SEBI proposed
tighter position limits in single-stock derivatives based on the stock’s liquidity.
The limit would be the lower of 15% of free-ﬂoat market cap or 60× the stock’s
average daily deliverable value . This move (still under consideration)
would align derivatives positions more closely with the size of the underlying
market, curbing outsized bets on illiquid stocks. For index derivatives, SEBI
relaxed certain limits for genuine hedgers – e.g. allowing index option positions
up to ₹1,500 crore net (₹10,000 crore gross) with no intraday cap – to facilitate
smoother institutional hedging .
Investor Warnings and Education: Since mid-2023, brokers are required to
display stark risk disclosures to anyone trading F&O (notably the statistic that
~90% of retail traders lose money). SEBI has run investor awareness campaigns
highlighting F&O risks . These measures, while not directly limiting
volume, aim to dampen the craze by ensuring traders understand the odds.
There’s also discussion of mandating ﬁnancial suitability tests or income
criteria for derivative traders (to distinguish HNIs from small investors), though
implementation is uncertain.
Collectively, these reforms have begun to cool the F&O market. By early 2025, SEBI
observed that despite a YoY dip in individual trading, volumes were “still
signiﬁcantly higher” than two years ago  –
indicating a more tempered but still active market. The immediate impact has been a
healthier balance: less of the ultra-short-term, high-leverage bets (especially on Bank
Nifty weekly expiries) that many newbies were drawn to, and a slight shift back
toward longer-duration contracts and institutional participation
. Regulators have signaled that they will continue monitoring and may
calibrate rules further to ensure “investor protection and systemic stability” in this
fast-growing market . In sum, India’s options
trading landscape in 2025 is still enormous by any measure – but it is gradually being
reined into a more sustainable trajectory after the frenzied growth of 2020–2023.
Key Metrics Summary (Last 2–3 Years)
Total Options Volume: Roughly 35–37 billion index option contracts per
quarter in 2024, doubling the 2022–23 levels . After late-2024 rules,
volumes fell ~30–40% but remain higher than 2021 levels.
9/22

Notional Turnover: Peaked around ₹7,000+ trillion/month on NSE in 2023 (with
BSE ~₹2,000 T) 【 28† 】 . Dropped to ~₹280 T/day in Dec 2024 (from ₹442 T)
, still ~+40% vs two years prior . India accounts for 60%+
of global equity derivative volumes by contract count .
Premium Turnover: ₹12.5 trillion premiums paid in Mar 2024 on NSE ( ≈ $150
bn) . Index options ~90% of this value . Premium turnover down 9%
YoY in early 2025, but +14% vs 2023 .
Retail Participation: Individuals’ share of volume ~35–40% in 2023  (up
from low single-digits pre-2020). ~96 lakh active retail traders in FY25 (2× the
number in FY22) . Retail trader count -12% YoY by early 2025 but still
+77% vs 2023 .
Category Turnover Split: Proprietary trading ~50–60% of volume
; Retail ~33–35% ; Foreign investors <10% .
Domestic institutions only a few percent (remainder).
Bank Nifty Index Options: Among the most traded contracts during 2020–2023,
often exceeding Nifty volumes. Weekly Bank Nifty options (Wed expiry) were
popular with retailers, but ceased in Nov 2024 by regulation . This
contributed to a large drop in overall index option counts (index volumes -72%
post-ban) . Some activity shifted to monthly expiries, and Nifty’s
Thursday weekly now dominates weekly turnover.
Retail Trader Outcomes: ~90% of retail F&O traders consistently lose money
. Total retail net losses: ₹40k cr (FY22) →  ₹65.8k cr (FY23) →  ₹74.8k
cr (FY24) →  ₹1.06 lakh cr (FY25) . Average loss per trader in FY25
~₹1.1 lakh . Losses peaked in Q3 FY25 then eased in Q4 as new rules
kicked in .

Overall, India’s options market saw extraordinary growth in 2020–2023, followed by
a measured reset in 2024–2025 due to regulatory intervention. Retail investors and
proprietary ﬁrms have been the main drivers of this market, while institutions play a
smaller role. Going forward, the landscape is likely to be shaped by ongoing
regulatory ﬁne-tuning – balancing the need to curb reckless speculation and
protect investors with maintaining market liquidity and eﬃciency
. The Bank Nifty frenzy has been tamed for now, and the data
suggest a healthier, if slightly lower, level of activity as the dust settles on SEBI’s
reforms. India’s options trading remains huge by global standards, but its
composition and growth trajectory are evolving toward a more sustainable path.

help ensure there's enough liquidity in the market, which means that trades can
happen smoothly without huge price swings. In India, market makers, including
proprietary trading ﬁrms, provide a signiﬁcant portion of the daily trading volume,
especially in index options like Nifty and Bank Nifty. If they were to step out of the
market even for a day, it could lead to wider bid-ask spreads, less eﬃcient pricing,
and potentially more volatility, which would aﬀect all participants. Essentially, market
makers help keep the market stable and eﬃcient.

Market makers make their proﬁt from the diﬀerence between the bid and ask prices,
known as the spread. They continuously provide both buy and sell quotes for a
security, so if someone wants to buy, they sell to them, and if someone wants to sell,
they buy from them. They adjust these prices based on supply and demand, as well
as market conditions. Essentially, their role is to provide liquidity by always being
ready to buy or sell, and they manage their risk by adjusting those prices to ensure
they can cover any potential losses.

In that scenario, the market maker would step in to provide liquidity between those

12/22

way, if someone wants to sell immediately, they’ll buy at 99.5 rupees, and if someone
wants to buy immediately, they’ll sell at 105.5 rupees. The diﬀerence between these
prices, known as the spread, is where the market maker earns their proﬁt. They
continuously adjust these prices based on market conditions and the ﬂow of buy and
sell orders to manage their risk and ensure liquidity.

If a buyer and a seller perfectly match at the same price at the same time, they can
indeed trade directly without needing a market maker. However, in reality, the market
is constantly changing, and buyers and sellers don't always appear at the exact same
moment or at the exact same price. Market makers ﬁll that gap by always being
ready to buy and sell, ensuring there's continuous trading and that the market stays
liquid. They help smooth out any discrepancies and reduce the time it takes for
trades to happen, making the market more eﬃcient overall.

Yes, exactly! Market makers manage an inventory of the stock or option contracts.
They buy when there's less demand and sell when there's more demand, earning the
diﬀerence in the process. This way, they help keep the market ﬂuid and ensure that
there are always opportunities for buyers and sellers to trade without signiﬁcant
delays or price jumps.

Market makers are very strategic about managing their risk. They usually hold a
balanced inventory and continuously adjust their prices to minimize exposure. If the
price of a security they hold starts to go down, they might quickly adjust their bid
and ask prices to reduce any potential loss. They also tend to hedge their positions
using other ﬁnancial instruments, like futures or options, to protect themselves from
adverse price movements. This way, they ensure that they don't take on too much
risk and can continue to provide liquidity consistently.

Market makers do operate on very small margins, but they rely on the high volume
of trades to generate proﬁts consistently. They do face tail risks, which are those rare
and extreme market events that can cause large, unexpected losses. To manage this,
they often have sophisticated risk management systems and use hedging strategies
14/22

to protect themselves. As for leaving opportunities for individual traders, market
makers create a more stable and liquid market that beneﬁts everyone, making it
easier for individual traders to enter and exit positions at fair prices.

In many cases, retail traders do end up trading against each other, and that’s where a
lot of the proﬁt and loss dynamics happen. Market makers and institutional players
are usually focused on providing liquidity and managing their risk rather than taking
large directional bets. This means that while market makers ensure that trades
happen smoothly, the actual proﬁt opportunities for retail traders often come from
their own strategies and from the behavior of other retail participants.

Market makers and large institutional players do have the ability to inﬂuence market
movements, especially in less liquid markets or during periods of low trading activity.
However, their primary goal is to facilitate trading rather than to move the market in
a particular direction. When they do make large trades that could impact the market,
they often break them into smaller orders or use algorithms to minimize their
impact. For individual traders looking to follow these large players, some look at
trading volumes, order ﬂow, or speciﬁc patterns to get a sense of what might be
15/22

happening. But it’s important to remember that these large ﬁrms are also very
sophisticated in managing their trades and risks.

When it comes to algo trading, some of the key variables to focus on include trading
volume, which helps you understand the level of activity and liquidity; price trends
and patterns, which can give you insights into market direction; order ﬂow data,
which shows you the buying and selling pressure in real time; and market depth,
which lets you see the levels of supply and demand at diﬀerent price points.
Additionally, many algo traders pay attention to volatility measures and news
sentiment to adjust their strategies dynamically. Keeping an eye on these variables
can help create a more robust and responsive trading algorithm.

“ W h a t  a r e  y o u  p o s s i b l y  d o i n g  w i t h  t h a t ? ”
Using these variables, an algorithm can quickly identify patterns and opportunities in
real time. For example, by looking at the buying and selling quantities, the algorithm
can detect when there’s a surge in demand or supply, which can indicate a potential
price movement. Market depth shows the levels of pending orders at diﬀerent prices,
helping the algorithm understand the strength of support and resistance levels. This
16/22

can be crucial for high-frequency trading, where the goal is to make very fast, small
proﬁts by taking advantage of these tiny price diﬀerences and market ineﬃciencies.

“ I  d i d n ' t  q u i t e  g e t  i t ,  c a n  y o u  e x p l a i n  w i t h  a n  e x a m p l e ? ”
Sure! Let’s say you have an algorithm that’s watching the market depth for a
particular stock. If it sees a large number of buy orders at a certain price level, that
suggests strong demand, and the algorithm might decide to buy in anticipation of
the price going up. On the other hand, if the algorithm notices a large number of sell
orders piling up at a certain price, it might anticipate that the price could drop and
adjust its strategy accordingly. This way, the algorithm uses real-time data to make
quick decisions and take advantage of small, short-term opportunities.

Yes, you've got the idea! Essentially, the algorithm is looking at those imbalances
between supply and demand at diﬀerent price levels. If there’s a lot of selling
pressure at a higher price, like 105, and not as much buying support until a lower
price, like 95, the algorithm might predict that the price will move downward to
where the stronger demand is. This helps the algorithm decide whether to buy, sell,
or wait, aiming to capitalize on those anticipated price movements.

The psychology behind it often comes down to the behavior of traders and their
reaction to supply and demand imbalances. When there’s a large supply at a higher
price, like 105, and not enough buyers willing to pay that price, sellers might start
lowering their prices to attract buyers, which can create a downward movement. On
the ﬂip side, if there's strong demand at a lower price, like 95, buyers might jump in
quickly to secure that price, creating upward pressure. The speed at which traders
adjust their prices can vary, but in fast-moving markets, it can happen quickly as
people try to avoid losses or take advantage of opportunities, which is something
algorithms are designed to capitalize on.

c a s e ? ”
In this scenario, an HFT algorithm might look at the order book and notice that
there’s strong demand at 95 and signiﬁcant supply at 105. With the current price at
100, the algorithm might anticipate that if the price starts moving down, it will
quickly ﬁnd buyers at 95, and if it moves up, it will meet sellers at 105. The HFT might
place very fast, small orders to take advantage of these tiny price movements
between 100 and those levels, essentially making proﬁts oﬀ these small ﬂuctuations
and providing liquidity in the process.

d o ? ”
18/22

If the price moves up to 101, the HFT might consider that there’s still that selling
pressure up at 105. So, it might quickly sell some shares at 101 to take advantage of
that slight upward movement, and then it could try to buy again if the price dips back
down. Essentially, the algorithm is looking to make small, quick proﬁts from these
tiny price changes while being mindful of those larger support and resistance levels.

High-frequency trading ﬁrms can indeed execute thousands of orders per second
when it comes to Nifty options. The actual volume they move in a single second can
vary widely depending on market conditions, liquidity, and their speciﬁc strategies.
Generally, it can range from hundreds to thousands of contracts in a very short span,
and when market activity is high, it can be even more. These trades are typically
small and fast, adding up to signiﬁcant volumes over time.

If you're placing an order for something like 15 lots, which is a relatively modest size
compared to what HFTs handle, you likely won't create a signiﬁcant market impact,
especially if the market is liquid and active. However, breaking your order into
smaller chunks and spreading them out over a few seconds can help you avoid any
sudden price changes and ensure that you get a more stable average price. It’s

generally a good practice to be a little cautious and minimize any potential slippage,
especially in fast-moving markets.

One scenario where individual traders can sometimes have an edge over HFTs is
when there’s a signiﬁcant event or a major shift in market sentiment that HFT
algorithms aren’t immediately programmed to recognize. For instance, during
unexpected news events, earnings surprises, or geopolitical developments, human
traders who can quickly interpret the context might act faster than algorithms that
need time to adjust. Also, in cases of extreme volatility, HFTs might pull back
temporarily to manage their risk, and that can create opportunities for individual
traders to step in and take advantage of price movements.

AI models can analyze a combination of historical data, real-time market signals, and
news sentiment to predict the likelihood of a stock moving up or down. They look for
patterns that have historically led to certain price movements. While AI can be quite
eﬀective, it's not always perfect. Sometimes the price might have already moved by
the time the AI processes the data, especially in fast markets. To improve accuracy,
traders often combine AI insights with their own judgment and other tools. The key
is to continuously reﬁne the AI model with new data and learn from its predictions to
improve future performance.
