Abhishek One - Making money in trading
How do people make large sums of money in trading 
starting with smaller capital 
Below is a practical “menu” of the six most common paths traders take when they
grow a relatively small account into a much larger one. None of them is easy money
—each demands skill, discipline, and a clear edge—but understanding the landscape
will help you decide where to focus your energy.
1. Trade instruments that give built-in leverage (futures, options, CFDs)
Why it works How small accounts use it wisely
You control a large notional value for
a small margin deposit, so a 2–3 %
move in the underlying can translate
to a double-digit move in equity.
Start with micro contracts (e.g., CME Micro E-mini futures or
SGX micro-sized Nifty contracts). They let you size positions in
₹10 k–₹30 k bites instead of the six-ﬁgure exposure of full
contracts. Keep total exposure ≤  3–4 × your account and set
hard stop-losses.
Retail participation in micro futures has exploded—2.6 billion contracts traded since
launch, and the CME has 500 k active retail futures traders today .
2. Exploit ultra-short-dated options (“0-DTE”) or weekly expiries
Edge: Tiny premium, massive gamma; a ₹30 option can become ₹300 within
hours.
Reality check: 0-DTE volume now makes up 61 % of all S&P 500 option trades
and ~54 % of that is retail ﬂow . Most lose money because slippage and
IV crush act like a casino rake.
Smart approach: Treat it as event-driven trading (Fed day, key earnings). Risk a
ﬁxed fraction (e.g., 0.3 % of capital per play) and cap daily loss.
3. Pass a “funded trader” (prop-ﬁrm) evaluation
1/18

Prop ﬁrms front you $50 k–$400 k once you prove consistency on a demo. You pay a
₹10-25 k challenge fee instead of risking your own capital, then keep 70–90 % of
proﬁts. Industry pass rates are only 5–10 %, so you need a rules-based system and
tight risk control .
4. Systematic/stat-arb & algorithmic approaches
1. Find a repeatable edge – e.g., IV-spike mean reversion in Bank Nifty options
(exactly the dataset you said you’re collecting).
2. Back-test exhaustively – aim for a Sharpe > 1.5 and max drawdown < 20 %.
3. Compound – even 3 % a month grows ₹5 lakh to ~₹12 lakh in three years
(without fresh capital).
4. Scale via leverage or external funding once the live track record is > 12
months and audited.
Because the edge is statistical, you can deploy more capital without changing
behaviour—unlike discretionary day trading where cognitive load scales with size.
5. Niche liquidity-providing / market-making
Crypto DEXs, single-stock options, or small-cap equities often have wide spreads and
rebates. Writing very short-dated options or posting passive orders can earn you
consistent cents-per-share; leverage magniﬁes this. It’s tech-heavy (you need
colocated bots or at least fast APIs), but you already code in JS/TS and Python, so the
entry barrier is knowledge, not tooling.
6. Build a public track record and raise outside capital
If you compound a ₹10 lakh account at 40 % CAGR for two years, you have ~₹19.6
lakh and (more importantly) a veriﬁed curve. Platforms like Darwinex Zero,
QuantConnect Alpha Streams, or even SEBI-registered PMS routes let you 10× AUM
without touching your own risk capital. Fee + performance share can eclipse what a
solo account would ever scale to.
2/18

Putting it into a step-by-step plan (adapt for your Bank Nifty-
options project)
1. Deﬁne the niche & instrument – e.g., intraday IV-spike fade on Bank Nifty
weekly options.
2. Collect tick/second-bar data – you already have six months; extend to two years
for regime testing.
3. Design entry/exit & position-sizing rules (Kelly-fraction capped at 0.5 × to
reduce variance).
4. Back-test & Monte-Carlo – stress test against 2020 crash, 2022 inﬂation spike,
2024 election rally.
5. Paper-trade for 30 sessions to ensure live ﬁlls match assumptions.
6. Go live at 1 ×-to-2 × leverage. Keep max daily loss = 1 % of equity.
7. Track every trade & equity curve; review weekly. When the 90-day curve shows
Sharpe > 2 with <10 % drawdown, scale either by:
Adding futures overlays,
Taking a prop-ﬁrm futures challenge, or
Pitching a small friends-and-family pool.
Risk & survivorship truths
Compounding works both ways. –10 % needs +11 % to get back; –50 % needs
+100 %.
Variance matters more than average return. A steady 3 %/mo beats a roller-
coaster 20 %/-18 %/15 %.
The median retail options account is down, even while headline stories
celebrate the rare lottery winners .

Bottom line:
Turning a small stake into “life-changing” money is possible, but only with repeatable
edge + strict risk control + patience to compound. Pick the pathway that matches your
technical strengths (you already code and analyze data), prove your edge in micro
size, then scale through leverage or external capital—not by randomly betting bigger.
This overview is educational and not investment advice; test and size every strategy
carefully before deploying real capital.

Practical tips before you swipe the card
1. Storage hunger: One year of pure options TBT is > 3 TB compressed—budget
cloud storage and a Parquet/ClickHouse pipeline.
2. License scope: Exchange data can’t be re-shared; if you plan to publish or sell
signals, negotiate a redistribution addendum.
3. Time-zone & leap-second quirks: NSE ﬁles are IST time-stamped; convert to UTC
early to avoid DST confusion.
4. Test a sample day ﬁrst: Vendors will often give you one trading day free—run
your parser on it before committing.
5. GST & invoicing: Indian vendors quote net of 18 % GST; if you have a GSTIN you
can claim input credit.
Bottom line:
7/18

For raw tick-level precision, either buy NSE’s own HTBT archive or an authorised
vendor who sells that same feed in smaller, cheaper chunks.
For strategy back-testing without terabytes, platforms like AlgoTest bundle 1-
minute option-chain history that’s “good enough” for many retail algos.
Pick the tier that matches your storage budget, latency needs, and licence
obligations—then start crunching!

But i am looking for tick by tick data or 1 sec data but 
at a reasonable cost, for eg. rs 5k a day data from nse 
is too high for me as a individual, i am looking for 
something like 2-3 years of data for rs 10k-15k
Below are three budget-friendly ways Indian retail traders usually assemble 2-3
years of Bank Nifty / Nifty derivatives data without paying the ₹4-5 k per DAY that
NSE charges for the full HTBT feed.

2 Buy “single-symbol archives” from authorised vendors (₹6 k –
₹12 k for 3 yrs)
Vendor Product you ask for Typical quote*
Why it ﬁts your ₹10-15 k

Global

≥  12 months in one
go.
Two years of BANKNIFTY

TrueData Tick archive (trade-
only) for chosen
symbols.
Older ﬁles ₹150–₹200
per symbol per month;
fresh ﬁles cheaper if
bundled with a live
plan.
BANKNIFTY + NIFTY for 36
months ≈  ₹10 k. The live
“tick-data upgrade” shows
the ball-park.
TickByTick.in /
Comtel
CSV “per-symbol” tick
dumps.
₹180 – ₹250 per
symbol-month.
Same maths as above; call
and negotiate.
*Quotes are what recent retail buyers have reported; all three vendors will give a
formal pro-forma invoice once you mail them your symbol list.
Tips to keep the invoice small
1. Buy only what trades: ask for BANKNIFTY FUT, plus the top-10 strikes (highest
OI) on each expiry.
2. Take older data in bulk: vendors slash prices by ~40 % on >12-month lots
because they simply copy from archival disks.
3. Ask for 1-sec “compressed” instead of every packet: same price but 95 %
lighter storage.
3 Use open, community datasets to plug gaps (₹0)

Source Contents Caveats
Kaggle – “BankNifty 1-
minute 2015-2024”
Clean 1-minute OHLCV up
to Mar 2024.
Use as far-back ﬁller, then
splice higher-resolution vendor
data for recent years.
Putting it together for ₹10-15 k
1. Download free 2015-2023 1-minute bars from Kaggle to seed your DB.
2. Licence 24 months (2023-2025) of 1-second or tick data for BANKNIFTY + the
handful of option strikes you really trade from Global Datafeeds or TrueData ( ≈
₹7–₹9 k).
3. Top-up ongoing history for free via Breeze or Dhan APIs and append daily.
That leaves head-room in your budget for storage ( ≈  2 TB per 3 yrs of options ticks)
and a cheap VPS if you want everything in the cloud.
Reality checks before you pay
Even “compressed 1-second” ﬁles are ~1 GB per trading day when you keep all
strikes—budget disks ﬁrst.
Verify sample ﬁles on your parser before sending money; NSE epoch stamps can
be IST, nanoseconds, or both.
Exchange licence forbids redistribution; keep the raw ﬁles private if you plan to
sell signals.
Retail-vendor support beats DIY scraping—₹8 k once is cheaper than losing
weeks cleaning malformed ticks.
If you absolutely need full tick-by-tick with quotes
The only legal path is NSE HTBT at ₹4.8 k per day (₹24 L for 2 yrs) or institutional
feeds like TickData LLC (USD 8 k +). For most quantitative strategies a 1-second
consolidated trade/quote ﬁle is statistically identical but 99 % cheaper.
Bottom line:
With a little mix-and-match—free broker APIs, Kaggle 1-minute backﬁll, and a single-
10/18

symbol tick licence—you can amass 2–3 years of usable 1-sec / tick data for well
under ₹15 k without breaking NSE’s data rules or your wallet.

How to ﬁll the gaps cheaply
1. Build your own archive
Open a Zerodha or Alice Blue account (₹0 brokerage until you trade).
Use the ZerodhaWebsocket or Python-NSE-Option-Chain-Analyzer scripts
above; schedule them on a VPS. After six months you’ll have true tick data
(price + qty) for every strike you subscribe to—free except for disk space.
2. Single-symbol retail archives
Why so few truly “tick-by-tick” freebies?
NSE licenses the raw HTBT feed; anyone who republishes full ticks violates that
licence, so community sets either (a) aggregate to 1 s/1 min, or (b) share only
short rolling windows.
14/18

Global Datafeeds & TrueData will sell BANKNIFTY or NIFTY 1-sec
consolidated trades with volume at ~₹180–₹250 per symbol-month. Two
years of just those two underlyings lands comfortably in ₹10–12 k—even
after GST. (You’ll need to email their sales desk; the quote isn’t on the public
site.)
3. Re-sample what you download
All the Kaggle/GitHub sets above already carry per-trade quantity. If your
strategy is “relative volume per minute,” just groupby('timestamp').sum()
to roll ticks into 60-second buckets.
About Dhan’s 5-second charts & expired contracts
Granularity: Dhan’s public ChartIQ feed is hard-capped at 5 s for active
contracts. Their REST/historical API returns 1 min bars; no way (today) to query
the tick store directly.
Expiry blackout: once a contract expires, the chart UI hides it, but the backend
does keep data for ~1 year. If you need it, hit
https://data.dhan.co/options/historical?symbolToken=<token>&from=
<date>&interval=ONE_MINUTE — you’ll get JSON bars even for expired strikes
(requires an API key).
Not oﬃcially documented, may change without notice.
Quick checklist before you download
Step Why it matters
Verify headers Some sets timestamp in IST,
others UTC—rebase before
merging ﬁles.
Sample-parse Open 100 k rows to ensure
commas/decimals are
consistent; Kaggle uploads
aren’t always clean.
Storage plan 1 sec bars for two indices ~ 25
GB/yr; full tick ≈  1 TB/yr per
underlying.
15/18

Step Why it matters
Licence Community datasets are
research-only; don’t
redistribute raw ﬁles if you
plan to sell signals.
Bottom line:
While exchange-licensed tick data is pricey, the mix of Kaggle F&O archives (with
volume), open-source tick collectors, and low-cost per-symbol retail archives lets you
assemble multi-year second-level Bank Nifty/Nifty options history inside your
₹10–15 k budget—plus some VPS disk.

Quick checklist before you start exporting
1. Zoom in ﬁrst—GoCharting only exports bars currently loaded.
2. Match time-zones: timestamps come in IST (UTC+5:30).
3. Mind the 9 k limit: if you choose 1-sec or 5-sec charts, you’ll need multiple
exports and then concatenate.
4. Include OI column: add the built-in Open Interest indicator before exporting if
you need per-bar OI.
Bottom line: GoCharting can be a handy, near-free source of up-to-second Bank
Nifty/Nifty option bars—especially for last-year testing—so long as you work within
the 9 k-bar window or script around it. For anything deeper or full tick granularity,
you’ll still need an authorised retail archive or the NSE HTBT feed.
