Primarily.  -- Including like daily costs and the annual 
income tax gain, like income tax on gains etc. And also 
tell me how do people circumvent those as well. 
Here's a complete breakdown of intraday options trading taxation in India, with a
focus on Bank Nifty and Nifty options — including daily costs, income tax
treatment, and common circumvention practices (for awareness, not endorsement):
🧾  1. Tax Classiﬁcation for Intraday Options Trading
✅  Nature of Income
Intraday trading in options (e.g. Bank Nifty/Nifty) is classiﬁed as:
Speculative Business Income applies to intraday equity & squared-oﬀ options.
Non-Speculative Business Income applies if options are carried to expiry or
delivery-settled (not typical for Bank Nifty/Nifty options).
📆  2. Daily Trading Costs Breakdown
Cost Component Typical Rate Explanation
Brokerage ₹20 per order (ﬂat rate,
Zerodha/Upstox etc.)
Intraday trades usually ₹20 per
executed order
"Business Income" — speciﬁcally, speculative business income if settled
intraday (i.e. no physical delivery), including squared-oﬀ options (even though
options are derivatives).
1/8

Cost Component Typical Rate Explanation
STT (Securities
Transaction Tax)
₹0.05% on sell side only
(for options)
E.g., Sell ₹1L worth options →
STT = ₹50
Exchange
Transaction
Charges
~₹0.053% on turnover (NSE
F&O)
Levied by NSE
GST 18% on (brokerage +
transaction charges)
Tax on broker services
SEBI Turnover Fee ₹10 per crore (~₹0.0001%) Negligible
Stamp Duty ₹300 per crore (₹3 per ₹1L)
on buy side
Only on buy-side for options
📊  3. Annual Income Tax on Intraday Trading Gains
✅  Under Business Income
You must ﬁle ITR-3 (or ITR-4 under presumptive scheme in limited cases). You can’t
ﬁle ITR-2.
Slab Applicable Tax
Up to ₹2.5L No tax
₹2.5L – ₹5L 5%
₹5L – ₹10L 20%
> ₹10L 30%
Add 4% cess to all of the above.
Turnover is calculated based on absolute proﬁt/loss value (per ICAI norms for
derivatives).
Audit is required if turnover > ₹10 crore or if proﬁt is < 6% of turnover and
income exceeds taxable limit.
🔹  For Bank Nifty/Nifty intraday traders doing 10–20 trades/day, total round-trip
cost per trade often adds up to ₹35–50 per order, depending on volume.

📘  Example:
If your Bank Nifty intraday proﬁts for the year = ₹5.5 lakhs
Expenses claimed (laptop, internet, rent, tools) = ₹50,000
Net taxable business income = ₹5L →  Tax = 5% = ₹25,000
💡  4. How People Circumvent or Reduce Taxes (not legal advice)
🚫  Common Tactics (Gray or Illegal)
1. Not declaring trading income
Especially if net loss or negligible proﬁt.
Risky if you use popular brokers — tax dept gets this data.
2. Splitting accounts across family
To keep proﬁts in lower tax brackets.
3. Using ITR-2 or ITR-1 wrongly
Fails to report speculative business income.
4. Avoiding audit by manipulating turnover
E.g., booking losses on expiry to reduce total turnover.
5. Using presumptive income (44AD) wrongly
Not meant for speculative income.
✅  Legal Deductions People Use
1. Claim expenses:
Internet, phone, oﬃce rent, subscription (Chartink, TradingView), even
furniture if applicable.
Laptop depreciation can be claimed (60% in ﬁrst year).
2. Loss carry-forward:
Speculative losses: Carry forward for 4 years, only to be adjusted against
speculative proﬁts.
Non-speculative losses: Carry forward for 8 years.

30%)

📢  Pro Tip:
Would you like a sample Excel sheet to track daily proﬁt, turnover, and tax estimate
for Bank Nifty options?
Use tools like Quicko, Cleartax, or Zerodha Tax P&L Report to track turnover,
speculative income, and audit applicability automatically.
STT (Securities Transaction Tax)
₹0.05% on sell side only (for options)
E.g., Sell ₹1L worth options →  STT = ₹50
 --- 
You're right to question this. Let’s break it down precisely for Options Trading in
India — particularly relevant to Bank Nifty/Nifty Options:
📌  What is STT (Securities Transaction Tax) on Options in India?
4/8

STT applies diﬀerently for Options depending on whether you're selling or
exercising them:
Transaction Type STT Rate Applied On Explanation
Sell (intraday or
before expiry)
₹0.05% on premium value
(not notional)
Most common case for traders
Exercising options 0.125% on intrinsic value Rare – only when options are
exercised at expiry (in-the-
money)
Buy No STT — STT is not charged on buying
options
✅  Real Example: STT on Intraday Options Sell
Suppose you sell 1 lot of Bank Nifty CE:
Strike price: 47,000 CE
Premium: ₹100
Lot size: 15
Total value (premium × lot size) = ₹1,500
🧮  STT = 0.05% of ₹1,500 = ₹0.75
⚠  Common Mistake
That rate applies only for equity delivery, not for F&O.
💡  Tip
For daily active traders, STT is usually a very small part of trading costs for options
due to low premium amounts. However, if your option is exercised, the STT is
signiﬁcantly higher — avoid letting ITM options auto-expire unnecessarily to avoid:
✅  You pay only ₹0.75 STT on this intraday options sell.
Many assume STT is 0.05% on the notional value (e.g., 47,000 × 15 = ₹7,05,000),
which would be ₹352.50 — this is wrong for options sell.
5/8

Would you like a small calculator template for daily option trade costs (including STT,
brokerage, GST, stamp duty)?
0.125% of intrinsic value × lot size — this can be ₹200–₹1,000+ per lot.
So basically if I buy, if I ﬁrst sell an option worth 200 
rupees and then cover it at 190 and make 10 rupees 
proﬁt on it and my brokerage is free using Sunya or ﬂat 
trade then how much cost am I looking at per 
transaction per cycle and if I do that like 50 times a day 
how much am I looking at? 
Great question. Let's break it down step by step with your speciﬁc scenario:
📌  Scenario
Sell option at ₹200
Buy it back at ₹190
Lot size: 15 (Bank Nifty)
Proﬁt per trade = ₹10 × 15 = ₹150
Brokerage = ₹0 (with Sunya or FlatTrade zero-brokerage plans)
Number of trades/day = 50 round trips
✅  Per Trade Cost Breakdown (Buy + Sell)
🔹 1. STT (Sell side only)
0.05% of premium × lot size
Sell side premium = ₹200 × 15 = ₹3,000
STT = 0.05% of ₹3,000 = ₹1.50
🔹 2. Exchange Transaction Charges (Both sides)
NSE F&O: ~₹0.053% per side
Turnover = (₹200 + ₹190) × 15 = ₹5,850
ETC = 0.053% × ₹5,850 = ₹3.10
6/8

🔹 3. GST on ETC
GST = 18% on ETC
GST = 18% × ₹3.10 ≈  ₹0.56
🔹 4. Stamp Duty (Buy side only)
₹300 per crore = 0.003% on buy side
Buy value = ₹190 × 15 = ₹2,850
Stamp Duty = 0.003% × ₹2,850 = ₹0.0855 ≈  ₹0.09
🔹 5. SEBI Charges
₹10 per crore = 0.0001% of ₹5,850 ≈  ₹0.006
✅  Total Cost per Round Trip
Component Amount
STT ₹1.50
Exchange Charges ₹3.10
GST ₹0.56
Stamp Duty ₹0.09
SEBI Fee ₹0.006
Total per trade ≈  ₹5.25
📅  If you do this 50 times a day
Cost per trade = ₹5.25
Daily cost = ₹5.25 × 50 = ₹262.50
Daily gross proﬁt = ₹150 × 50 = ₹7,500
Net proﬁt = ₹7,500 −  ₹262.50 = ₹7,237.50
📆  Monthly Estimate (20 trading days)
Gross proﬁt = ₹7,500 × 20 = ₹1.5L
Trading costs = ₹262.50 × 20 = ₹5,250
7/8

Net monthly proﬁt = ~₹1.445L
Annual estimate = ~₹17.34L net proﬁt
⚠  Caveats
If you don’t always win, the costs remain, but proﬁts don’t. So if your win ratio
drops below ~70%, this starts hurting.
Slippages and execution delays might impact real-world proﬁtability.
✅  Conclusion
Yes, with zero brokerage, your per trade cost is only around ₹5.25.
If you’re consistent with execution and win rate, doing 50 trades/day can yield
serious compounding — but it’s high skill + high risk.
