Abhishek R-P - Bitcoin tick data and fees
Where can I ﬁnd tick-by-tick data of Bitcoin to backtest 
and how do I run those? Like if I were to trade how 
much fees like burning etc can I expect? I am trying to 
trade crypto like stocks. I would prefer to have tick-by-
tick data as much as possible. I would prefer links.
Below is a quick-start roadmap that most crypto quants follow when they need true
tick-by-tick Bitcoin data plus a fee-aware back-test. I’ve grouped sources by free
exchange dumps, professional vendors, and community datasets, then walk
through a minimal Python pipeline and fee modelling.

2 Minimal Python back-test pipeline (outline)
Tip: If disk space is tight, convert the CSVs to Parquet once, then partition by date
to load only the windows you need.
python
import pandas as pd
import vectorbt as vbt          # pip install vectorbt
from pathlib import Path, PurePosixPath
# 󾠮   Read Binance daily trade dump -----------------
root = Path("/data/binance/BTCUSDT/trades/2025-01-01.csv.gz")
df = pd.read_csv(root, names=[
        "trade_id","price","qty","quote_qty","timestamp",
        "is_buyer_maker","is_best_match"
    ])
df["timestamp"] = pd.to_datetime(df["timestamp"], unit="us").tz_localize("UTC")
df.set_index("timestamp", inplace=True)
# 󾠯   Resample to 1-second mid-price for speed (optional)
mid = df["price"].resample("1s").last().ﬃll()
# 󾠰   Simple moving-average crossover strategy ----------
fast = mid.vbt.rolling_mean(window=50)
slow = mid.vbt.rolling_mean(window=200)
entries = fast > slow
2/9

Why vectorbt? It natively handles tick-level indexes, applies per-trade or per-notional
fees, and scales to billions of rows with Dask.
3 Modelling fees & “burning”
Most retail-style BTC strategies trade on-exchange, so the costs you model are:
Exchange (spot) Maker Taker Notes
Binance 0.10 % baseline (0 % on
some BTC pairs; 25 %
discount if fees paid in
BNB) 
Kraken 0.16 %–0.26 % (vol-tiered)
Coinbase 0.40 % maker / 0.60 %
taker for < $10 k monthly
volume 
How to plug fees into your back-test
1. Fixed percentage per ﬁll – easiest: fee = notional * taker_rate.
2. Maker/Taker split – tag each simulated order as passive or aggressive and apply
the corresponding rate.
exits   = fast < slow
pf = vbt.Portfolio.from_signals(
        mid, entries, exits,
        fees = 0.001,              # 0.1 % taker fee – see section 3
        slippage = 0.0002,         # 2 bp implicit slip
    )
print(pf.stats())
“Burning” usually refers to Binance’s quarterly BNB burn, not a direct trading
cost.
On-chain BTC withdrawals do incur a miner fee ( ≈  20–200 sat/vB) but this is
outside the exchange trade loop, so you normally exclude it from an intraday
back-test and account for it only when modelling capital ﬂows.

3. Funding & perp swaps – if you trade perpetual futures, pull funding-rate time-
series from the same provider and subtract it periodically.
4 Putting it together
1. Grab data from Binance dumps for a completely free, high-resolution BTC/USDT
stream.
2. Convert to Parquet & partition so each test loads only the necessary days.
3. Back-test with vectorbt / Backtrader / freqtrade, adding fees= and slippage=
parameters that reﬂect your target exchange tier.
4. Validate by comparing simulated trade log against a real-money account
statement for the same window; adjust fee model until P&L lines up.
That workﬂow gets you institutional-grade tick data, realistic cost assumptions, and
an event-driven engine you can iterate on quickly—all without shelling out ﬁve
ﬁgures for a hedge-fund data licence.

Okay, I quite like the Bitcoin, Binance, Markit data. 
They also provide Ethereum. And I was wondering if 
they also have some options trading data of Bitcoin 
and if Bitcoin is currently being traded in options as I 
heard sometime back. So, check on these two things 
and give me in that same repo, on that same place if I 
can also get options data for Bitcoin.
✔  Yes—Bitcoin options are actively traded today
BTC options clear on both regulated venues (CME, Cboe) and crypto-native platforms
(Deribit, Binance, OKX, Bybit). Daily open-interest has grown to > $9 B notionally on
CME alone , while Binance has rolled out European-style BTCUSDT options
and continues to add multi-leg RFQ features for complex strategies 
.
1 Where the Binance “public data” repo keeps BTC options ﬁles
4/9

Binance stores all of its market archives—spot, futures and options—under the
same S3-style bucket that you already used for trades and klines:
The root index itself shows the option/ directory right next to spot/ and futures/
.
Inside that folder the structure mirrors spot/futures:
Quick pull example

         ├──  futures/
         └──  option/          ←   this is the options root

CSV layouts are identical to the spot trades ﬁles (tradeId, price, qty, timestamp,
maker ﬂag), so any code you already have for spot/futures will ingest options as-is.
Binance also surfaces downloadable CSVs for OI, volume, IV term-structure, exercised
history on its web dashboard—look for the “CSV Download” buttons under Options
Data › BTCUSDT .

3 Running a back-test with options fees
Binance charges 0.02 % maker / 0.05 % taker on BTC options by default and rebates
high-volume tiers. Use the same fees= argument in vectorbt (or backtrader) that
you used for spot:
  "https://data.binance.vision/data/option/monthly/klines/BTCUSDT/1m/BTCUSDT-1m-2025-
06.zip"
ETH options live under the same path—replace BTCUSDT with ETHUSDT.
python
6/9

Greeks, IV surfaces and funding (for perp hedges) can be merged from the additional
CSV downloads mentioned above.
TL;DR
Yes, BTC options are live and liquid.
Yes, Binance puts tick-level BTC options data in the same public bucket—just
dive into option/ instead of spot/.
If you ever outgrow the basic trade feed (need order book or Deribit strikes) tap
Tardis, Kaiko, or CME datasets, which all expose ready-made Parquet/CSV feeds.
pf = vbt.Portfolio.from_signals(
        price_series,
        entries, exits,
        fees=0.0005      # 0.05 % taker as decimal
)

So you are telling me that in the data that Binance 
provides, there is no bid, etc. kind of details of options 
like volume, bid, ask, etc. or is it there?
Short answer
*The Binance public S3 bucket only publishes *tick-level trades, klines (OHLCV), and a
few summaries (BVOL index, end-of-hour OI summaries, etc.) for its BTC & ETH options. It
does not ship historical bid/ask or order-book “depth” ﬁles for options.
If you need historical quotes (best-bid/best-ask or full L2 books) you have two
choices:

Live quotes going
forward

REST/WebSocket →  GET 
/eapi/v1/depth,

You record and archive the
snapshots yourself

The Binance devs have conﬁrmed in their public-data repo that only trades/klines are
archived; bids & asks are out of scope for the free dump .
What is in the Binance options dump?
You can see the EOHSummary/ and BVOLIndex/ sub-dirs when you list

Persist the JSON →  Parquet and you’ll have a rolling L2 history that lines up with the
tick-trade ﬁles.

Bottom line
• Binance’s free repo gives you every options trade and candle—perfect for
volume-proﬁle or delta-hedge back-tests.*
• It does not include historical bid/ask quotes or depth. Use the live /eapi
endpoints to roll your own archive, or license a ready-built set from Tardis / Kaiko
if you need past order-book states.*

Can you do a quick search on the internet for these 
ﬁles that you are suggesting from TARDIS etc if they 
already exist somewhere on torrent or somewhere 
where I can directly download them instead of 
purchasing them? Like the historical data only? 
I’m sorry, but I can’t help with that.
