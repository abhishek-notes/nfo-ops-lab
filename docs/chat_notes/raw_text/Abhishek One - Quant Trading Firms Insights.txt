Sure! Firms like Tower Research and Jane Street are known as quantitative trading
ﬁrms or high-frequency trading ﬁrms. They use complex mathematical models and
algorithms to trade large volumes of securities at extremely high speeds. They
capitalize on very small price discrepancies in the market, often holding positions for
just fractions of a second. They rely heavily on technology, data analysis, and
infrastructure to maintain their edge.
In India, you have similar quant ﬁrms, though the market is still growing. Some
notable names include ﬁrms like Alphagrep and iRageCapital, which also engage in
algorithmic and high-frequency trading.
These ﬁrms make money by being faster and more eﬃcient at identifying trading
opportunities than others. They often have advantages in terms of data access,
analytical models, and trading infrastructure. For someone looking to understand or
follow their lead, it can be tricky because their strategies are usually proprietary and
they trade so quickly. However, understanding the principles of quantitative analysis,
using data-driven strategies, and maybe even exploring algorithmic trading on a
smaller scale can be a good start!

Yeah, that's a great question! So these big ﬁrms deﬁnitely still have to pay
government charges and fees, but because they're trading at such high volumes and
at such high speeds, they can make up those costs through the sheer number of
transactions. They also often have special arrangements with exchanges, which can
lead to lower transaction costs because they're providing liquidity to the market.
As for why some people in India open companies to trade instead of doing it
individually, it’s often about tax eﬃciency and access to certain beneﬁts. When you
trade through a company, you might be able to deduct certain expenses, and the
proﬁts might be taxed diﬀerently compared to personal income. It can also look
more professional and open doors to certain types of investments and funding. If
you have a proprietary ﬁrm, it means you're essentially running your own trading
business, which gives you more ﬂexibility and potential tax advantages. It also allows
you to scale up operations more easily.

Absolutely! So, if you already have a proprietary ﬁrm for your web development
business, you can deﬁnitely use the same entity for trading as well. To create a
trading account on a platform like Zerodha, you'll need a few documents, like your
ﬁrm’s registration details, the PAN card of the company, the ﬁrm's bank account
details, proof of address, and the authorized signatory’s details. The process is pretty
straightforward, and Zerodha will guide you through it.
Now, about the taxes and charges for high-frequency trading: these ﬁrms do pay
transaction charges on every trade, but because they're trading in such large
volumes, they often negotiate lower fees with exchanges. The taxes, like the
securities transaction tax in India, still apply, but because their margins are based on
extremely fast trades and small price diﬀerences, they still end up proﬁtable. They
settle their taxes at the end of the day or in regular intervals rather than per
transaction, which makes the process more eﬃcient.

Yes, you're right! The Securities Transaction Tax, or STT, is set by the government, and
it applies equally to everyone, whether you're an individual trader or a big ﬁrm. So
3/49

they can’t negotiate that particular tax with the government. It’s a ﬁxed rate and
everyone has to pay it. However, where they do have ﬂexibility is with the brokerage
fees and other transaction costs, because they trade so frequently and in large
volumes, they can negotiate lower fees with the exchanges or brokers. But the STT
itself is uniform and controlled by the government, so that doesn't change.

Sure, let's break it down with a simple example. So, if you buy an option at 100
rupees and then sell it at 110 rupees, and the lot size is 30, that means your total
proﬁt would be 10 rupees per option times 30, which is 300 rupees. Now, in terms of
fees, you'd have a few diﬀerent charges. First, there's the brokerage fee, which
depends on your broker. For Zerodha, for example, it’s usually a ﬂat fee of about 20
rupees per executed order. Then you have the STT, which is charged on the selling
side of the transaction for options. There's also the exchange transaction charge,
which goes to the exchange itself. There might be some GST on the brokerage and
transaction charges, and a few other small fees like stamp duty and SEBI charges.
When you add them all up, it still leaves you with a good proﬁt margin, especially if
you're trading in large volumes and frequently, because those fees become a smaller
percentage of your overall trading activity.
00:13
“ S o  h o w  a r e  t h o s e  t a x e s  c a l c u l a t e d ?  L e t ' s  a s s u m e  t h a t  I ' m

w h a t  h a p p e n s ? ”
So even if you're using a broker with zero brokerage fees per transaction, you'll still
have to pay the standard government taxes and charges. The Securities Transaction
Tax, or STT, is calculated as a percentage of the transaction value. For options, it's
4/49

typically charged on the selling side. Then there are the exchange transaction
charges, which are set by the exchange itself, and you'll also have GST on those
charges. You might also have a small stamp duty and SEBI turnover fee. All of these
fees are automatically calculated and deducted when you complete your trades, so
even with zero brokerage, those government taxes and exchange fees will still apply.

Yeah, so besides the high-frequency trading ﬁrms that operate on really short
timeframes, there are also large institutional investors and hedge funds that hold
positions for longer periods, like hours, days, or even weeks. In India, you have ﬁrms
like Kotak Mahindra Asset Management, ICICI Prudential, HDFC Mutual Fund, and
others that manage large portfolios and might take positions that they hold for
longer periods. These ﬁrms often use a mix of fundamental and technical analysis to
make their decisions and might not trade as rapidly as HFT ﬁrms, but they still play a
signiﬁcant role in the market and can inﬂuence trends over longer periods.

Got it, you’re looking for more of the proprietary trading or quant ﬁrms that are
similar to Jane Street and Tower Research. In India, some notable names include
ﬁrms like Alphagrep, iRageCapital, and Axyon. These ﬁrms are known for their
algorithmic and high-frequency trading activities and often have a presence in
5/49

multiple markets, including India. They use sophisticated quantitative models and
technology to trade, and while they do a lot of high-frequency trading, they can also
hold positions for longer durations depending on their strategies.

“ J u s t  t e l l  m e  h o w  t h a t  w o r k s  a n d  t h e n  w e ' l l  d i v e  i n t o  t h a t . ”
Sure! When these ﬁrms hold positions for a longer duration, like an hour or even a
few hours, they're often using a strategy that looks at slightly larger trends or
patterns in the market. They might be looking at technical indicators, market
sentiment, or news events that can inﬂuence prices over that slightly longer period.
They might also be taking advantage of short-term ineﬃciencies or arbitrage
opportunities that can’t be captured in just a few seconds. It's hard to know exactly
when they’re in a trade because they keep their strategies very secret, but you can
sometimes see patterns in the market where there’s a noticeable move or a certain
trend that aligns with their trading activities.
00:03
“ W h a t  k i n d  o f  n o t i c a b l e  t r e n d ?  G i v e  m e  a n  e x a m p l e . ”
Sure! One example could be when a ﬁrm identiﬁes a short-term price ineﬃciency
right before a signiﬁcant news event, like an earnings release or an economic report.
They might take a position anticipating that the market will react in a certain way. For
example, if they expect a stock to jump after a positive earnings report, they might
buy in advance and hold that position for an hour or so until the news is out and the
6/49

price moves in their favor. Another example could be arbitrage opportunities where
they notice a price diﬀerence between the same asset on two diﬀerent exchanges,
and they hold their position until that price gap closes. These patterns can
sometimes be seen as sudden spikes in volume or quick price movements that
happen around key market events.

Yeah, so price diﬀerences like that between the NSE and the BSE can happen for a
few reasons. One is that there might be a slight delay in updating prices between the
two exchanges, or there could be diﬀerences in liquidity, meaning that one exchange
might have more active trading for that stock than the other. Arbitrage traders
actually look for these diﬀerences and step in to buy on the cheaper exchange and
sell on the more expensive one, which helps bring the prices back in line. Usually,
these diﬀerences are pretty small and don’t last long because of this arbitrage
activity, but it can still happen from time to time.

You're right, if the diﬀerence persists over a longer period, there could be other
factors at play. Sometimes, it could be due to diﬀerences in trading volumes or
investor behavior on each exchange, or even diﬀerences in the availability of shares.
Another reason could be that certain stocks are more actively traded or more
popular with investors on one exchange compared to the other. It could also be
7/49

related to settlement cycles or diﬀerences in how certain large trades are executed.
Sometimes, regulatory factors or index fund activities can also cause small but
persistent diﬀerences. So it's deﬁnitely a combination of factors that can lead to
those discrepancies.

Sure! Some of the well-known international Wall Street ﬁrms that have a presence or
operations that extend to India include ﬁrms like Citadel, which is a major player in
both market making and hedge fund strategies, and Virtu Financial, which is a global
leader in electronic market making. Another example is Two Sigma, which is known
for its quantitative trading strategies and operates globally. Then you have ﬁrms like
DRW, which engages in both high-frequency trading and longer-term strategies. All
of these ﬁrms use a combination of advanced technology, quantitative analysis, and
sometimes hold positions for longer periods depending on their strategy.

Yeah, that incident you're talking about is often associated with what's called
"spooﬁng," where a trader places large orders to create a false impression of
demand or supply and then cancels those orders before they get executed. This can
trick high-frequency trading algorithms into reacting and moving the market. The
trader then takes advantage of that temporary price movement.
HFT algorithms often look for patterns and market signals to make ultra-fast
decisions, and while these algorithms are complex, some of their logic is based on
detecting order book imbalances, volume spikes, or momentum shifts. For individual
traders, you can deﬁnitely use algorithms or automated strategies, but on a slightly
slower scale. There are tools that help with algorithmic trading over seconds or
minutes, looking at technical indicators or trends, and while it's not as fast as HFT, it
can still give you an edge in the market.

So for capturing momentum, a common approach is to use technical indicators that
help you identify when momentum is building up. For example, you can use
something like the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which shows if a stock is
overbought or oversold. When the RSI crosses certain levels, it can signal strong
9/49

momentum. Another popular indicator is the Moving Average Convergence
Divergence, or MACD, which helps you see when momentum is shifting. You can set
your algorithm to enter a trade when you see a strong signal from these indicators,
place a tight stop loss to manage your risk, and then you can use a trailing stop to
lock in proﬁts as the price moves in your favor. These indicators and strategies are
commonly used by both professional traders and individual traders, and they can
deﬁnitely help you ride that momentum eﬀectively.

I totally get where you're coming from. The reality is that the really advanced
algorithms used by top ﬁrms are highly proprietary, and they involve a mix of
complex statistical models, machine learning, and real-time data analysis. They
might look at things like order ﬂow, market microstructure, or even use AI to predict
very short-term price movements. For individual traders, it's deﬁnitely more about
ﬁnding a strategy that works consistently for you, managing your risk, and staying
adaptable, even if we don't have the same resources as the big ﬁrms!

I understand the curiosity around those sophisticated strategies, but the reality is
that these top ﬁrms keep their algorithms and methods extremely conﬁdential for a
reason. Their edge in the market comes from that secrecy, and those strategies often
require massive data analysis, advanced technology, and infrastructure that’s hard to
replicate on an individual level. The best approach is to focus on solid, well-known
strategies and reﬁne them, manage risk, and ﬁnd what works best for you.

I totally understand that you're looking for something more advanced, and I
appreciate your curiosity! While I can't share proprietary strategies from these ﬁrms,
what I can say is that they often look at very nuanced data, like market
microstructure, patterns in the order book, or even use machine learning to identify
hidden patterns. They also do a lot of backtesting on historical data to reﬁne their
models. So, for an individual trader, the best approach is to keep learning, keep
experimenting with diﬀerent strategies, and stay adaptable in the market.

I'm deﬁnitely here to help you out and share what I can! In terms of machine
learning algorithms that trading ﬁrms might use, they often rely on models like
random forests, gradient boosting machines, or neural networks. These models help
them identify patterns in large datasets and make predictions about short-term price
movements. They also do a lot of feature engineering, which means they carefully
select and transform data to feed into these models. Hopefully, that gives you a bit of
insight into how these ﬁrms operate!

When it comes to backtesting with machine learning, one common approach is using
a random forest algorithm. This type of model can handle a variety of features, like
price movements, volume, and technical indicators, and it can help identify patterns
in the data. Another popular model is gradient boosting, which builds an ensemble
of decision trees to improve prediction accuracy. For time series data, like what you
have with Bank Nifty, you might also consider using recurrent neural networks, or
RNNs, which are designed to work with sequential data. Just remember to carefully
validate and test your models to make sure they generalize well and manage your
risk as you experiment.

beyond common knowledge and provide a deeper, more technical understanding.
This includes research papers, books, and any detailed studies on the speciﬁc
machine learning models, neural networks, and quantitative techniques these ﬁrms
employ. Additionally, I'd love to ﬁnd resources that might also be useful for an
individual with a background in software development and mathematics who wants
to experiment with building and testing these models on their own. The goal is to
gain exposure to high-quality, advanced resources that can be iterated on and
implemented for deeper learning and experimentation.

Got it! Here's an updated and even more comprehensive prompt you can use:
I'm looking for advanced, in-depth resources on the algorithms and strategies used
by top high-frequency and quantitative trading ﬁrms like Renaissance Technologies
and Citadel. I want to dive into the speciﬁc mathematical, machine learning, and
neural network algorithms
Continue, and also make sure that we're not just 
talking about Renaissance Technologies and Citadel. 
Include ﬁrms like Jane Street, Tower, and others as well. 
I would also like a bit of understanding about mutual 
funds, such as Kotak Mahindra, and how to ﬁgure out 
when they are trading in a certain stock.
If possible, include information on hedge funds too. 
The whole goal is proﬁt, so please prioritize that.
As I understand, the big ﬁrms usually operate on 
indexes and stocks with very high volatility, like Bank 
Nifty and Nifty. However, I am open to trading smaller 
stocks, provided there are solid algorithms that can 
actually generate proﬁts on single stocks where the 
trading quantity is not as high as index options.
The main focus should be on options trading. Please 
keep that as the priority. However, if you ﬁnd 
something exceptionally good in research papers or 
16/49

books related to other areas, I am open to including 
that as well.
Update the prompt accordingly and make it as 
comprehensive as possible. Take the full context of this 
conversation into account and create a truly detailed 
and eﬀective command for me. 
Here's a fully updated, highly detailed and comprehensive research prompt for your

Let me know how you'd like to proceed.
Okay, I have entered that prompt into an AI researcher 
and I should get the results back soon.
23/49

For now, my question is: let's consider the fact that 
there are some stocks with really low volatility. 
Sometimes they have options on them, like RG, but 
most of them don't. Let's say there are multiple stocks 
like those—big companies, but the trading volume is 
so low that you don't really know when they're going to 
move or when the bid and ask prices will match.
What are some possible algorithmic trading strategies 
for them, for small quantities? Since big ﬁrms don't 
operate on them, is there a chance that an individual 
like me can actually run some algos and make a proﬁt 
there?
Please give me some suggestions on that. 
This is a smart and nuanced question. You’re thinking in the right direction. When it
comes to low-volatility, low-liquidity stocks, most big players stay out because:
The capital deployment isn't scalable.
The risk of slippage and getting stuck in illiquid positions is high.
Market-making isn't proﬁtable without enough two-way ﬂow.
But for a small retail trader or a small prop desk, these ineﬃciencies can
sometimes be opportunities if you size correctly and understand the dynamics.
✅  Algorithmic Strategies for Low-Volatility, Low-Liquidity Stocks
1. Mean Reversion on Micro Moves (Intraday to Multi-Day)
Core Idea: Illiquid stocks often "mean revert" after random large trades that
move the price 2–4% on thin volume.
How to Use: Use statistical bands (Bollinger Bands, z-score deviations) or simple
VWAP reversion intraday.
Tools: Rolling VWAP, standard deviation-based reversion bands.
Holding Time: Minutes to a few hours, or 1–2 days max.
Risk: If a genuine directional event occurs, you’re trapped on the wrong side.
24/49

2. Hidden Liquidity Sniping
Core Idea: Often, big players hide their orders with iceberg orders or dark pool
equivalents.
How to Use: Build order book algorithms to detect patterns like:
Repeated small ﬁlls at the same price.
Sudden pullbacks in the best bid/ask.
Place passive limit orders at these likely hidden levels and wait for ﬁlls.
This requires live order book access (Level 2 data).
3. Price-Insensitive Algo "Takers"
In some illiquid stocks, you’ll ﬁnd sellers/buyers who hit the market order button
without caring about 0.5–1% slippage.
A small bot that waits for these conditions and trades against them can capture
the spread.
Example Strategy: Watch for a seller that dumps a block at 2% below VWAP →
Buy →  Wait for price to mean revert.
4. Small-Scale Arbitrage (Rare but Possible)
If the stock trades on multiple exchanges (like NSE + BSE), price discrepancies
occasionally persist longer than they should.
Place simultaneous limit orders on both exchanges to proﬁt from these small
gaps.
These are low-frequency arbitrage opportunities that big ﬁrms don’t bother
with due to tiny size.
5. Event-Driven Micro Trading
These stocks will often move on results day, board meetings, or dividend
announcements.
Build a simple event detection algo that watches for price + volume + news
spikes and enters quickly.
Hold for a short period (scalp the ﬁrst 10–30 min of reaction).
25/49

6. Volatility Expansion Algos
Sometimes, volatility suddenly spikes after months of quiet. You can:
Monitor options IV (if available) or price volatility.
Buy small positions anticipating larger directional breakouts.
Use ATR (Average True Range) expansion triggers.
⚙  Why This Works for Small Players
No one’s competing with you on such small quantities.
Market makers aren't interested in 10-lot trades in illiquid stocks.
Because you're taking small, well-planned trades, even if you get stuck for a bit,
your capital isn't frozen.
⚠  Key Risks to Manage
Wide bid-ask spreads →  Always use limit orders.
Sudden illiquidity →  You might not be able to exit when needed.
Overnight gaps (especially in news-driven moves).
🔍  Tech You'd Need
Live market depth data (Level 2) to monitor order book behavior.
Basic statistical models to quantify mean reversion.
Simple backtesting of your own signals (Backtrader, Zipline, or even pandas).
Optional: sentiment monitoring tools for event detection.
🚨  What Not to Do
Don’t blindly copy big-ﬁrm strategies (like market-making) in these stocks.
Don’t use market orders unless absolutely necessary.
Don’t trade too big for the liquidity. If the stock trades 5000 shares/day, don’t buy
1000 shares in one go.
If you'd like, I can help design:
26/49

A simple backtest for such strategies using your 6-month Bank Nifty data as a
base.
A micro-strategy for 1–2 speciﬁc stocks you identify.
Would you like to go deeper into designing the exact signal logic for one of these
strategies?
In most of these cases, even though I get access to 
Level 2 data—which includes bid quantities and bid 
and ask prices—the issue is that the illiquidity is 
sometimes so severe that I can't exit the trade. That's 
not a situation I want to be stuck in.
I've often noticed that price movements in these 
scenarios happen slowly. People might be waiting for 2 
hours, and then suddenly the price jumps in 2 or 3 
seconds. It might stay at that level for another 30 
minutes, then either move further up, come down 
slightly, or fall signiﬁcantly. 
What you're describing is a classic illiquid market dynamic where:
1. Small trades and orders keep the stock in a tight range.
2. A sudden market order or block trade causes a sharp price jump.
3. Post-spike, the price often "stalls" or "consolidates" as no further liquidity
comes in.
This happens in many small- and mid-cap stocks globally. You're right to be cautious
about getting trapped, because in these scenarios:
You might see the price print higher but with no actual market depth to exit
into.
Even if Level 2 shows bids/asks, they can vanish instantly.
🔑  Reﬁned Algorithmic Trading Ideas for These Situations
1. Trade the Post-Spike Stabilization, Not the Spike Itself
Don't try to catch the initial breakout.
27/49

Instead, build an algo that detects when a sharp spike happens (e.g., price +1.5%
in <3 seconds) AND THEN look for stabilization.
If the price holds for 10–15 minutes without a reversal, you can try a small buy
with a limit sell slightly above the spike.
This approach limits the risk of getting caught in the initial whipsaw and focuses on
capturing the post-spike drift.
2. Use Micro-Timing Windows
From your description, spikes happen rarely but sharply, then price stagnates.
Your algo can be built around:
Wait for no movement (tight range) for >60 minutes.
Trigger a watch mode when a breakout happens.
Enter only after conﬁrmation (e.g., the price stays above the breakout
level for >5 minutes).
Set a time-based exit: if nothing happens within X minutes, exit.
This keeps you from being stuck endlessly waiting for another trader to move the
price.
3. Liquidity-Adjusted Entry and Exit
You can develop a liquidity score:
Measure traded quantity in the last 5 minutes vs. the last 60 minutes.
If the last 5 minutes > X% of prior hour, liquidity is increasing →  safer to trade.
If it’s still dry, avoid entering even after a price jump.
4. Exit Using Passive Orders Well Before You Need To
Don't try to exit at the top. Instead:
Place a passive sell order at a logical resistance zone and let others lift it.
If the price never reaches there, cut your position smaller on the way down
rather than waiting for liquidity to evaporate completely.
28/49

5. Alternative: Don't Trade Illiquid Stocks Intraday →  Swing Trade
Instead
If you like these stocks' ineﬃciencies but not the intraday liquidity risk:
Look for patterns on daily candles (e.g., false breakouts, support zones).
Take overnight swing trades with predeﬁned risk.
You accept the illiquidity but avoid the tick-by-tick anxiety.
⚠  Exit Liquidity Will Always Be the Bottleneck
No algo can solve the core problem of:
Thin market depth.
A lack of counterparties willing to buy your shares after your entry.
So your core focus should be:
Enter only when others are showing signs of participating.
Keep your trade size small enough that you can exit on limit orders without
needing a market buyer.
🎯  Bottom Line Strategy for You
Trade small →  small gains add up without getting stuck.
Use time-based exit rules.
Target post-spike stability rather than trying to catch the move itself.
If you'd like, I can help you design a:
Python backtest of this spike-then-stabilize strategy.
Real-time signal logic for trading tools like TradingView/Pine Script or Kite
Connect.
Do you want to work on the signal-building next, or would you prefer to discuss how
to identify the right illiquid stocks for this approach?
Can you suggest some stocks that I can trade which 
are not typically targeted by high-frequency trading 
29/49

ﬁrms, but still have enough liquidity?
I'm looking for stocks that ﬁt this description. 
This is a sharp question. You're essentially looking for “mid-liquidity” stocks:
Too illiquid and boring for big ﬁrms like Jane Street or Tower to care.
But liquid enough that you can enter and exit without getting trapped.
They won’t usually have tight spreads like Bank Nifty or Reliance, but they also
won’t have crazy 10–20% gaps like microcaps.
🔍  Key Criteria for Stocks You're Describing:
Criteria Range to Look For
Daily traded value ₹5 crore – ₹200 crore (sweet
spot: ₹20–₹80 crore)
Average bid-ask
spread
< 0.5%, preferably 0.1% – 0.3%
Price stability (low
intraday IV)
Moves slowly unless event-
driven
Option chain Optional (good if it exists, but
not mandatory)
Typical HFT activity Low to negligible (few ﬂash
trades)
Market Cap ₹5,000 – ₹50,000 crore (mid-
cap zone)
Sector Often industrials, chemicals,
mid-tier IT, auto ancillaries, or
PSU stocks
   Example Indian Stocks to Consider (As of 2024 data; re-verify
latest liquidity):
30/49

These are mid-cap to lower large-cap stocks with moderate liquidity:
Stock Symbol Sector Notes
Mphasis IT/Software Large enough to trade, but not
highly volatile.
Bosch Auto Ancillaries Expensive stock, moderate
liquidity, rarely HFT-targeted.
Coromandel Intl Chemicals Steady institutional interest,
but no major quant
competition.
Cummins India Capital Goods Steady performer, tends to
have clean trends.
Honeywell Auto Automation Very low HFT activity due to
stock price, but stable liquidity.
ICICI Securities Financial Services Some institutional ﬂow, no
major quant footprint.
Pﬁzer India Pharma Steady, not widely traded
intraday, but has some day-to-
day ﬂow.
GlaxoSmithKline
Pharma
Pharma Similar to Pﬁzer.
Bharat Electronics
(BEL)
Defence PSU Sometimes has volatile phases,
but no major HFT footprint.
Oracle Financial
Services
IT Low activity but enough
volume for swing/intraday
trades.
Container Corp
(CONCOR)
Logistics PSU, trades in spurts, decent
liquidity.
⚠  Stocks to Avoid Based on Your Criteria
31/49

Stock Reason
Reliance, TCS,
Infosys
Too liquid, heavily HFT-driven.
PSU Banks (BOB,
PNB, etc.)
Retail + HFT dominated on
news days.
Penny stocks &
microcaps
Illiquid, high manipulation risk.
SME stocks Not enough liquidity,
unpredictable moves.
Recently listed IPOs Usually have weird liquidity in
ﬁrst 3–6 months.
🛠  How to Screen These Stocks Yourself
1. NSE/BSE Daily Bhavcopy:
Look for stocks with:
₹20–100 crore daily traded value.
Volume consistent across multiple days.
Reasonable bid/ask spreads.
2. Check Option Chain (Optional):
See if they have decent OI (Open Interest) and option volume.
Even if you trade the stock, options activity shows broader trader interest.
3. Use TradingView Screener:
Filters:
Market cap: Mid/Large
Average daily volume: Medium
Volatility: Low/Medium
Price: ₹300 – ₹3,000 (sweet spot for mid-cap activity)
✔  Why These Stocks Fit Your Style
They're boring for HFT ﬁrms but interesting enough for fund managers, pension
funds, and swing traders.
32/49

If you’re trading with small quantities (e.g., ₹50K–₹2 lakh position sizes), you can
trade smoothly.
Liquidity is enough to enter/exit without overnight risk — provided you’re
cautious on event days.

Algo ideas speciﬁc to one of them.
Isn't STT too high for stocks like Reliance, etc., for HFTs 
to trade? 
Great observation. Let’s break this down clearly.
✅  1. STT in India: A High Cost for Equity HFT
In India, Securities Transaction Tax (STT) on equity delivery and even intraday trades
is comparatively high when measured against razor-thin proﬁt margins of HFTs.
Segment STT Rate (2024-25 approx)
Equity delivery
(buy/sell)
~0.1% on both buy and sell
Intraday equity (sell
side only)
~0.025% on sell
Equity Futures ~0.0125% on sell
Equity Options ~0.0625% on sell of premium
(not on entire contract)
For high-frequency trades where expected proﬁt per trade might be <0.02%,
👉  STT alone wipes out the edge in stocks like Reliance, TCS, HDFC Bank, etc.
33/49

✅  2. Why HFTs Still Trade Reliance & Nifty 50 Stocks
Despite this, some HFTs still participate in Reliance, Infosys, HDFC Bank, but here's
why:
They focus mostly on futures & options, where STT is much lower.
They may participate in market making or arbitrage, where the counterparty
pays a worse price (capturing bid/ask spread, not pure directional trade).
Some ﬁrms oﬀset costs by rebates from exchanges for providing liquidity.
However, pure equity HFT is much rarer in India than in the US or Europe, largely
because:
STT is a ﬂat percentage of the trade value →  doesn’t scale with order size.
No maker-taker rebate model like in the US.
Higher latency in exchange infra makes ultra-fast scalping less viable.
✅  3. So Why Do Big Names Like Reliance Still Have Tight
Spreads?
Large institutional brokers and DII desks (mutual funds, PMSs, custodians)
provide liquidity.
Some lower-frequency quant traders or prop desks who can take overnight risk
trade there.
Retail + intraday traders also ﬁll in some liquidity.
But pure sub-second HFTs likely avoid equity cash trades for Reliance, TCS, etc.,
unless:
They have a futures hedge.
They’re running risk-neutral arbitrage (cash-futures, ADR arbitrage, ETF
arbitrage).
🔍  Bottom Line for You:
➡  High STT makes pure equity HFT in India unattractive.
➡  HFTs focus on:
Futures (Bank Nifty, Nifty, Reliance Futures, etc.)
Options
34/49

Or cash equities in very limited use cases (hedged, arbitraged, or market-making
on both sides).
🚨  Your Opportunity Zone
For you, mid-cap equities or small-cap futures (where HFT competition is lower and
STT is proportionally smaller on your small trades) can be fertile ground.
If you're OK trading small quantities, some low-volatility mid-caps can be sweet
spots, where:
HFTs are absent,
STT hurts less because you're not scalping every second,
And you can swing trade or do low-frequency intraday.
👉  Want me to shortlist futures contracts or cash equities with lower STT impact and
no major HFT footprint?
I'm okay with trading smaller quantities, but there 
should be enough liquidity, and the cost of trading 
shouldn't be too high. I might not always make a proﬁt, 
and I may not always be right, so that's a consideration 
as well.
I'm also trying to keep things on the cheaper side, so 
that if my calculations work out, I can make a proﬁt. 
Thank you for the clarity — your priorities are now very clear:
✔  Trade smaller quantities →  avoid liquidity risk.
✔  Keep costs low (STT, brokerage, slippage) →  protect thin proﬁt margins.
✔  Accept occasional losses →  strategy must be robust to wrong trades.
✔  Focus on stocks with decent liquidity but little competition from HFTs.

🔍  Recommended Types of Stocks & Instruments
1. Stock Options on Mid-Liquidity Stocks
Example stocks whose options have decent volume but are not Bank Nifty/Nifty-
level crazy:
Stock Sector Option Liquidity Notes
Tata Chemicals Chemicals Medium Steady OI, low IV jumps.
Cummins India Industrials Low–Medium Check monthly expiry; less
noise than indices.
Godrej Properties Real Estate Medium Can trend cleanly after
breakouts.
ICICI Securities Financials Low–Medium Smaller crowd, but tradable
some days.
Hindustan
Aeronautics (HAL)
Defence Medium Big news events occasionally
create swings.
36/49

Stock Sector Option Liquidity Notes
Container Corp
(CONCOR)
Logistics Low–Medium Day-by-day liquidity varies, be
cautious.
These options are not ultra-liquid, but with small quantities (1–5 lots), you can often
enter/exit without much slippage.
➡  Why stock options?
STT applies only on the sell side of the premium, not on the full stock price.
Lower competition = fewer HFTs eating your edge.
2. Intraday Cash Trades on Mid-Liquidity Stocks
If you don’t want to trade options:
Trade intraday only to minimize STT (0.025% only on the sell side).
Focus on stocks with ₹20–₹100 crore daily traded value.
Use limit orders to avoid crossing wide spreads.
Example stocks:
Coromandel International
Bharat Forge
Oracle Financial Services
Aarti Industries
Castrol India
3. Small Positions in Single Stock Futures
Stock futures are taxed only on 0.0125% of the sell value, making them the cheapest
instrument in India from a tax perspective.
If you can stomach slightly higher volatility, this could work:
Buy/sell 1–2 lots only.
Example: Mphasis, BEL, Polycab, PI Industries, Bata India, etc.

💡  Practical Recommendations
Stick to stock options & intraday cash trades for now.
Start with a few names, track their daily option chain liquidity + cash turnover.
Place only limit orders to control entry/exit price.
Focus on risk: even if your accuracy is 50–60%, tight cost control will keep you
proﬁtable.
➡  If you'd like, I can:
Generate a dynamic shortlist of stocks matching your liquidity & cost criteria
using recent NSE data.
Help create a simple Python or Excel-based watchlist that ﬂags when your target
stocks have suﬃcient liquidity to trade.
Would you like me to do that?
I am not against options, even though I prefer them. I 
just want to clarify that my focus is not to lose due to 
HFTs.
My motivation and goal is to play alongside them, 
38/49

follow their lead and patterns, and ﬁnd opportunities 
to proﬁt from their actions, not from their losses.
I understand that they are much better than an 
individual trader and are likely to win. I am not trying 
to put them out of business or beat them, but rather to 
proﬁt along with them. With direct stock options, I am 
somewhat concerned about the high fees and low 
liquidity. Even if I choose higher liquidity stocks like 
Reliance, the transaction costs are still high.
I'm not necessarily committed to either side at the 
moment, but I would say my focus is preferably on 
options. 
Thank you — this makes your intent much clearer. Your mindset is smart and
pragmatic:
→  You want to ride the coattails of the big players, not ﬁght them.
→  You want to use options, but only where the liquidity and cost make sense.
→  You care most about timing, entry/exit precision, and minimizing cost leaks.
Let’s break down your approach and reﬁne your opportunity set:
✅  Your Trading Philosophy Recap
Area Your Approach
Goal Follow big ﬁrms’ patterns;
don’t compete head-to-head.
Primary Instrument Options (preferred), but open
to stocks if costs/liquidity ﬁt.
Target Players HFTs, smart quants, option
market makers.
Proﬁt Source Move alongside them when
they act on volatility/spreads.
39/49

Area Your Approach
Concern Avoid getting eaten by bid/ask
spreads, STT, and poor ﬁlls.
🔍  How to “Ride Along” with HFT/Quant Activity in Options
1. Trade the Liquidity
HFTs trade where liquidity is.
So focus on:
Bank Nifty Options (weekly expiry, ATM/near OTM).
Nifty Options (slightly lower proﬁts but lower slippage).
Possibly FINNIFTY (on some days).
Even though STT applies, these options have:
Super tight spreads (₹0.5–₹1.5 in ATM options).
Constant ﬂow →  easier to enter/exit without moving the market.
Visible big player activity (OI shifts, implied volatility moves).
2. Watch for Volatility Shifts
HFTs & market makers adjust option prices when IV (Implied Volatility) shifts.
If you spot IV spiking before price moves →  you can front-run a breakout or
hedge ﬂow.
Example approach:
Bank Nifty 15 min before RBI announcement: sudden rise in IV without price →
signals hedge building →  you can buy an ATM straddle.
3. Play the “Liquidity Pocket” Game
Big players often create temporary liquidity gaps:
Suddenly increase spreads pre-event.
Quickly tighten spreads right after.
If you monitor order book depth:
You can place passive limit orders just inside the spread.
Get ﬁlled when big players sweep the book or hedge quickly.

➡  Stock options often have wide spreads + low volume, making them costlier and
riskier for your size.
🎯  My Recommended Path for You
Step 1: Focus on Bank Nifty & Nifty Options
Weekly ATM & 1 strike OTM options.
Follow liquidity, watch OI shifts.
Trade intraday, avoid overnight theta decay unless intentional.
Step 2: Trade Alongside Liquidity, Not Against It
Don’t chase low-volume stock options yet.
Ride the volatility and hedge ﬂows in the index options where:
STT is lower (since it applies only to premium on sell).
Spreads are tight (so even small moves give you a chance to exit proﬁtably).
Step 3: Build a Liquidity-Signal Based Algo
Examples:
Track sudden shifts in bid/ask depth or IV.
41/49

Watch for VWAP divergence on options vs. underlying.
Monitor 5–15 min OI changes on Bank Nifty options chain.
🔬  If You Later Want to Expand to Stocks
You can move to cash equities (intraday) in mid-caps where spreads and costs are
manageable. But stock options should be your third priority, after:
1. Bank Nifty/Nifty options
2. Cash equities intraday
If you want, I can help build:
An algorithm that tracks IV spikes + OI build-ups + liquidity shifts.
A backtest for ATM/OTM Bank Nifty options with 6-month data.
A watchlist that shows when market makers are active vs passive.
▶  Would you like to start building that algo, or do you ﬁrst want to shortlist which
options strikes/times to focus on?
sure build these things 
Great, we'll build this step by step. Here's the plan:
🔧  Phase 1: Build the Core Signal Engine
✅  1. Implied Volatility Spike Detector
Track ATM and ±1 strike Bank Nifty options.
Compare current IV with 5-minute and 15-minute moving averages.
Trigger a “watch” when IV increases by >5% in 2–5 minutes without a matching
price move.
✅  2. Open Interest Change Monitor
Pull Bank Nifty options OI every 5 minutes.
42/49

Detect sudden OI build-up in ATM/near OTM strikes (>15–20K contracts in a few
minutes).
Separate bullish (calls) and bearish (puts) OI increases.
✅  3. Liquidity Shift Scanner (Order Book / Bid-Ask Depth)
Track bid/ask spread in real time.
Detect:
Sudden widening of spreads before key events.
Instantaneous tightening right after →  suggests market maker re-entry.
Monitor changes in bid/ask quantities.
⚙  Phase 2: Combine into Trade Signals
Example:
✅  IV spike + call OI build-up →  Bullish setup →  Buy ATM Call.
✅  Wide spreads narrow + IV stays elevated →  Market stability →  Enter a
straddle or strangle.
✅  IV spike but no price or OI →  Likely false alarm →  No trade.
🔬  Phase 3: Backtest on 6-Month Bank Nifty Options Data
Run this logic on your dataset to:
Check how often signals triggered.
Measure average move in your favor.
Measure stop-loss hits.
Calculate cost impact (brokerage, STT, spread losses).
🚀  Phase 4: Real-Time Deployment (Optional Next Step)
Once backtested:
Build this into a Python + Kite Connect (Zerodha) or Upstox API script.
Use WebSockets for real-time data feeds.
Trigger Telegram or Slack alerts when a trade setup occurs.
43/49

➡  Next Step:
Please upload your 6-month Bank Nifty options dataset (CSV, JSON, or DB dump).
If you don’t have it ready, I’ll start by drafting the backtest and signal-detection code
skeleton in Python.
Do you want to upload your dataset now, or should I create the Python signal
detection framework ﬁrst?
Are there any annual reports or 10-K reports from 
some of these high-frequency trading ﬁrms that can 
give me an idea of how they operate, or is there 
nothing available? 
Excellent question. The answer varies depending on the type of ﬁrm:
✅  1. Private Quant/HFT Firms →  No 10-Ks, but Sometimes
Limited Disclosures
Firms like Jane Street, Tower Research, DRW, Hudson River, IMC, Jump Trading,
Optiver, Flow Traders (except Flow Traders NV) are privately held, so they:
Don’t ﬁle 10-Ks with the SEC.
Rarely disclose revenue or trading breakdowns publicly.
Occasionally ﬁle limited ﬁnancials in jurisdictions like the UK or Netherlands.
May be mentioned indirectly in exchange ﬁlings or when involved in regulatory
issues.

• Focus on volatility, low latency, and capital eﬃciency.
While they don't provide proprietary algorithmic details (models, thresholds, tick
rules), they conﬁrm that their edge is in microstructure exploitation and
neutral delivery via technology.
🛠  What You Can Extract & Apply
Objective 1: Liquidity-Focused Trading
Place passive limit orders to capture spreads, much like these ﬁrms. Focus on
instruments where liquidity is steady (e.g., Bank Nifty options).
Objective 2: Focus on High-Flow Windows
Trade during events that spark rapid IV or volume increases, mimicking
professional market makers’ actions.
Objective 3: Capital Discipline
Use strong cash reserves to hold and exit positions as needed. For you, this
means small position sizing and strong risk controls.
