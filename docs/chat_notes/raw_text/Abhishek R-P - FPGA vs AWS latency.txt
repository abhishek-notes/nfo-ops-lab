Abhishek R-P - FPGA vs AWS latency
Another quick question. So when I'm doing backtesting 
or let's say if I were to trade stocks and I have a certain 
formula, I heard, I read, whatever we even talked 
about this, that HFTs use FPGAs. So as I understand like 
if I do my formula on the computer that is gonna get 
processed in like 40 microseconds, I was wondering 
how fast can an FPGA do it and will it actually aﬀect my 
case if I use FPGA. the server of AWS in Mumbai 
instead of a co-location in Nse like that kind of a deal. 
Short answer: an FPGA won’t move the needle for you unless you’re physically at (or
extremely close to) NSE’s colocation and on a low‑level feed/order path. From AWS
Mumbai (or any non‑colo setup) your latency is dominated by the network and
broker stack, not your 40 µs compute.
Here’s the practical breakdown.
What FPGAs actually buy you
Where they help: parsing the market feed, maintaining the book, doing a few
risk checks, and emitting an order with near‑zero jitter. Typical tick‑to‑trade on
tuned FPGA stacks is sub‑microsecond to ~5 µs for simple strategies, measured
inside the colo using kernel‑bypass NICs.
CPU best case (colo, kernel bypass): ultra‑tuned C++ with DPDK/onload can do
~3–10 µs tick‑to‑trade. You can absolutely be competitive on CPU if you’re
colocated and disciplined about engineering.
GPU: great for throughput, not for microsecond‑class latency.
So your 40 µs formula time on a normal server is already “fast enough” if you were
colocated; many shops spend more time shaving NIC/driver jitter than math time.
Why it won’t help from AWS (or home/oﬃce)
Even if your compute were 0.5 µs on an FPGA, your packet still has to travel:
Physics: light in ﬁber is ~200,000 km/s ⇒  ~5 µs per km (one‑way). If an AWS AZ
is, say, 30–70 km ﬁber distance from NSE’s colo, that’s ~150–350 µs one‑way
best‑case physics, ~300–700 µs RTT.
1/12

Reality: add routing, switches, internet or MPLS edges, broker RMS/OMS checks,
API gateways, throttles, etc. You’re very commonly at 1–10 ms tick‑to‑trade (often
worse) when you’re not in the exchange colo.
Retail broker APIs: typically add milliseconds of queueing and risk checks. This
dwarfs your 40 µs compute—and any FPGA gains.
Bottom line: from AWS Mumbai, network + broker stack is your bottleneck. An FPGA
doesn’t ﬁx that.
What the pros do (and when FPGA makes sense)
Exchange colocation (NSE colo), direct market data (PTP), kernel‑bypass NICs,
deterministic clocks (PTP/SyncE), and either:
FPGA path: nanosecond–microsecond determinism, expensive, specialized
dev (Verilog/VHDL, toolchains), long lead time.
CPU path: hand‑tuned C++/Rust with DPDK or Onload, core pinning, busy
poll, huge pages, no syscalls, no GC, careful cache layout. Competitive
latency with much lower complexity.
Typical outcomes (colo):
FPGA tick‑to‑trade: <1–5 µs (simple logic)
CPU tick‑to‑trade: ~3–20 µs (well‑tuned)
Network to venue gateway inside colo: single‑digit to tens of µs
End‑to‑end (market event →  order on the wire): tens of µs
Cost & complexity reality check
FPGA cards: ~$5k–$30k each; dev time is the real cost.
Engineering: months to build/verify; niche skillset. Every exchange protocol
nuance lives in your gateware.
Colo: you need membership or a sponsoring broker, certiﬁed gateways, and
audited risk controls. Opex is non‑trivial.
What will improve your results right now
For your Bank Nifty/Nifty options scalping use‑case:
1. Proximity > hardware: if you can’t be in NSE colo, get as physically close as
possible (a Mumbai DC with a dedicated low‑hop link to your broker’s OMS in
Mumbai). Shaves milliseconds.
2. Broker path: use a broker oﬀering FIX with a Mumbai gateway (not internet
REST), low RMS overhead, and sensible throttles. This is often the biggest unlock.
2/12

3. Kernel bypass on CPU: even oﬀ‑colo, a tuned Linux stack (DPDK/Onload, IRQ
aﬃnity, RPS/RFS oﬀ, power governor performance, no Nagle, SO_BUSY_POLL,
pinned cores) reduces jitter.
4. Strategy design: favor signals that are robust to 1–5 ms latency (e.g.,
event‑driven with conﬁrmation, micro‑rebates, or short momentum that isn’t
purely ﬁrst‑touch). If you must scalp microstructure, you basically need colo.
5. Batching & risk pre‑checks: precompute as much as possible; keep per‑order
work O(1) and object‑pool everything to avoid allocations.
6. Data path: subscribe to the fastest feed your broker oﬀers; minimize
JSON/Protobuf overhead (binary where possible).
Rule of thumb for your decision
If your round‑trip (market event to order ack) is > ~500 µs: FPGA won’t help;
focus on network path and broker.
If you are in or near colo and already sub‑100 µs end‑to‑end on CPU: then
FPGA might be worth it for jitter/consistency and last‑mile µs.
TL;DR
Your 40 µs compute is not the bottleneck; the network and broker path are.
From AWS Mumbai, expect ms‑class latencies; an FPGA won’t change that.
To play true HFT (µs‑class), you need NSE colo (or equivalent proximity),
kernel‑bypass networking, and a highly tuned stack. CPUs can get you
surprisingly far before you need an FPGA.
1.Proximity > hardware: if you can’t be in NSE colo, 
get as physically close as possible (a Mumbai DC with a 
dedicated low‑hop link to your broker’s OMS in 
Mumbai). Shaves milliseconds. -- which is closest data 
center i can choose, i would be using ﬂattrade or 
shoonya from ﬁnvasia as those are free brokerage, or 
let me know what is a way to get free brokerage 
without them -- you can use internet if needed -- so for 
this kind of situation give me the best possible stuﬀ
Here’s a reﬁned breakdown to help you:
3/12

1. Best Proximity to NSE (Mumbai – BKC area)
 
.
Top nearby data center hubs in Mumbai / Navi Mumbai:
 
 
 .
Takeaway: The STT and CtrlS data centers around Mahape/Navi Mumbai are
among the closest to NSE’s BKC colocation footprint. Sify's Rabale/Airoli hubs oﬀer
strong carrier-neutral, low-latency connectivity, though slightly farther than Mahape.
These are your best bets for achieving near-exchange proximity without NSE
colocation.
2. Free Brokerage Platforms with APIs
 
 
To reduce latency, you’d ideally want your server colocated in a data center physically
close to the NSE’s Exchange Plaza in Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC), Mumbai
STT Navi Mumbai DC 2 (Mahape, Navi Mumbai) — eﬀectively 0 km from STT’s DC
1
CtrlS Mumbai DCs — several data centers within about 0.5‑0.7 km from Mahape
region
Sify Data Centers (Rabale, Airoli, Vashi) — high-performance, hyperscale
facilities with rich connectivity, including cross-connects and multiple ﬁber paths
Other providers: Yotta, Iron Mountain, STT, Nxtra, etc., with multiple data
centers across Mumbai
You’re using Flattrade and Shoonya. Both are zero‑brokerage, but their
infrastructure proximity isn’t optimized for ultra‑low‑latency.
Here are other Indian brokers oﬀering free APIs:
Flattrade — zero commission, free REST API. HQ in Chennai (Ambattur)
Shoonya (Finvasia) — zero commission, API-enabled platform. Headquartered in
Mohali, with Mumbai oﬃces
ICICI Direct (Breeze API) — free API including historical data & WebSocket live
feed
Other brokers with free APIs:
Zerodha (Kite Connect)
4/12

Upstox
Motilal Oswal
 
Community feedback:
So yes, Flattrade is popular among algo traders for being commission-free and API-
ready.
3. Recommendations for Your Setup
If your goal is lowest latency oﬀ-exchange:
1. Host VMs in a Mumbai/Navi Mumbai DC that’s carrier-neutral and close to NSE
BKC—such as STT (Mahape) or CtrlS around Mahape.
2. Use a free API-oﬀering broker with servers in Mumbai:
Flattrade or Shoonya (Finvasia) are zero-brokerage, though API latency
depends on their backend location.
For lower-latency options, consider ICICI Direct (Breeze API) or
Zerodha/Upstox—just check their infrastructure location and execution
speed.
3. Connect your colocated VM to your chosen broker’s Mumbai-facing API endpoint
using dedicated ﬁber or low-hop link for minimal network jitter.
If you're optimizing for cost-eﬀective algo backtesting or development:
Continue using Flattrade or Shoonya for API access—they're free and suﬃcient
for strategy testing.
If you test seriously, consider benchmarking execution latency with APIs from
Zerodha/Upstox or Breeze to compare.

Which of these data centers are like AWS where I can 
easily host things and work my way on like and it 
should not be too expensive like AWS gonna cost me 
like 2500 rupees per month for T3 something like that. 
Got it — you’re looking for Mumbai-proximate hosting like AWS Lightsail/EC2
where:
You can spin up a VM quickly (no corporate sales hoops like traditional colos)
Pricing is in the AWS Lightsail / EC2 T3 range (~₹2,500/month)
Ideally already in/near the NSE ﬁber neighborhood for lower latency
Here’s what’s worth considering:
1. Cloud Providers with Mumbai Region (AWS-like experience)
6/12

Provider
Mumbai
Region? Cheapest VM (monthly) Notes
AWS Lightsail ✅ ₹2,370/mo (USD $28) for 1
vCPU / 1 GB RAM / 40 GB
SSD
Very easy, but network
latency to NSE ≈  1–3 ms (not
colo-level)
Google Cloud
(GCP)
✅ ₹2,200–₹2,500 for e2-
micro with sustained use
discount
Smooth devops, Mumbai
region
Azure ✅ ~₹2,400/mo for B1s VM
with pay-as-you-go
Mumbai DC, easy
management
Linode (Akamai) ✅ $5/mo (~₹420) for 1 GB
RAM / 1 vCPU / 25 GB SSD
Has Mumbai location,
cheaper than AWS
Vultr ✅ $5/mo (~₹420) for 1 vCPU
/ 1 GB RAM / 25 GB SSD
Mumbai location; very easy to
spin up
DigitalOcean ✅ $5/mo (~₹420) for 1 GB
RAM / 1 vCPU / 25 GB SSD
Mumbai DC, stable API, easy
UI
💡  Cheapest easy-entry pick:
Linode, Vultr, or DigitalOcean in Mumbai. You get cloud-like provisioning, and 1 GB
instances for ~₹420–₹500/month — ~5× cheaper than AWS Lightsail for similar spec.
2. VPS Providers Hosted Inside Mumbai/Navi Mumbai Data
Centers
These aren’t “full hyperscale clouds” but give you a VM inside Indian DCs, often closer
to NSE’s physical footprint than AWS.
Provider Location Price (monthly) Notes
HostDime India Navi Mumbai ~₹600–₹800 for 1
vCPU / 1 GB RAM
More latency-friendly to NSE
ESDS Navi Mumbai Starts ~₹500 Indian cloud provider, direct
peering
7/12

Provider Location Price (monthly) Notes
Netmagic (NTT) Multiple Mumbai
DCs
Contact sales Closer to enterprise pricing
CtrlS Mumbai/Navi
Mumbai
Contact sales Needs enterprise commit, not
as self-serve
⚠  These usually require manual signup or ticket and are not as self-serve as
AWS/Linode/Vultr.
3. My Recommendation for You
Since you:
Want to spin up quickly like AWS
Want low cost (~₹2,500 or less)
Are ok with not being colo-level low latency, just “closer than Delhi/Chennai”
➡  Start with Vultr Mumbai or Linode Mumbai for testing.
Example:
Vultr Cloud Compute (1 vCPU / 1 GB RAM / 25 GB SSD) →  $5 USD (₹420/mo)
Latency to NSE Mumbai gateway likely ~1–2 ms if your broker’s OMS is in
Mumbai
You can easily upgrade to higher CPU/RAM when needed
Same SSH, API, snapshot workﬂow as AWS
If you later want true NSE-adjacent hosting but still with monthly rental & no colo
contracts, you could:
Rent a dedicated server from Mumbai DC resellers on HostUCan, Hetzner-
resellers, or ESDS Navi Mumbai.
Or lease a 1U server in STT Mahape via a broker’s infra partner.
If you want, I can pull real-time ping tests from Vultr Mumbai / Linode Mumbai /
DigitalOcean Mumbai to NSE’s colo IPs so you know exactly which one has the
8/12

lowest latency for your broker’s endpoints before you choose. That way you won’t
guess—you’ll see numbers.
Do you want me to do that next?
sure, also do from digital ocean and aws as well
 .
Why General Ping Tools Can't Tell You Everything
 .
What To Do Instead: Empirical Testing
1. 
2. 
3. 
Unfortunately, I couldn't fetch live latency numbers from DigitalOcean, AWS, or other
providers to a speciﬁc NSE colocation endpoint (since those require actual ping tests
from real servers). Public tools like CloudPing or GCPing report general browser-to-
cloud-region latencies—not connectivity to Exchange APIs—so they don’t reveal the
precise network performance to NSE’s servers
But here’s the low‑latency insight I can oﬀer you—derived from general principles
and existing data:
CloudPing / GCPing measure latency from your browser's location to cloud
provider regions—not from one cloud server to another (or to NSE)
The real path, especially in algorithmic trading, is server-to-server (e.g., your VM
in Mumbai →  your broker’s OMS/NSE gateway). That often uses private peering
layers not probed by browser-based tools.
To truly optimize for lowest latency, you need to:
Spin up a trial VM in each provider’s Mumbai region (DigitalOcean, AWS
Mumbai, Vultr/Linode).
Ping or run TCP checks to your broker’s actual order gateway endpoint (or a
known NSE-accessible IP) from each server.
Compare round-trip times (RTT), jitter, and packet loss.
This approach gives you real-world, relevant numbers—far superior to theoretical
estimates.
9/12

Why Proximity Still Matters
 .
 .
Thus, being geographically close (e.g., Mahape, Navi Mumbai—a few km from BKC)
still matters, but only if your broker’s infrastructure is equally nearby.
Next Steps You Can Take Right Now:
1. Create trial servers:
AWS Mumbai region (EC2 / Lightsail)
DigitalOcean (BLR1 Bangalore region—closest they oﬀer)
Vultr or Linode (Mumbai, if available)
2. Run latency tests (e.g. ping, hping, tcptraceroute) against:
Your broker’s Mumbai OMS/API endpoint
NSE’s market-data entry point (if publicly testable)
3. Collect metrics:
Average RTT
Peak/RMS latency
Packet-loss or jitter feedback
4. Choose the winner:
If one cloud provider shows less than ~1 ms better connectivity, that could
be meaningful.
If diﬀerences are all in the 5–20 ms range, then network proximity to the
vendor and broker becomes more critical than “small cloud advantage.”

Can you ﬁnd on the internet where the ﬂat trade and 
Shunye servers are located? They must have 
mentioned somewhere, some things like that. I think 
they might be like co-located or whatever but I want 
you to know. Check on internet and then come back to 
me with proper information. 
Flattrade (Fortune Capital Services Pvt Ltd)
 
Shoonya (Finvasia)
 
I dug around online to ﬁnd any indication of where Flattrade or Shoonya host their
trading servers or APIs. Unfortunately, there’s no publicly available conﬁrmation
that reveals their exact server locations or colocation status.
Flattrade’s registered and main oﬃce is in Ambattur, Chennai, at Kochar
Technology Park, which is clearly listed on their website.
While their corporate footprint is in Chennai, there’s no public information
conﬁrming whether their trading or API servers are colocated—for example, in
Mumbai or near the NSE exchange infrastructure.
Shoonya is headquartered in Mohali, Punjab, with additional oﬃces in Mumbai,
per its Wikipedia listing.
11/12

Despite having a presence in Mumbai, there’s no public detail indicating where
their executive or API servers are located—whether they're in Mumbai
colocation zones (like Mahape, Navi Mumbai) or elsewhere.
Bottom Line
Flattrade: Oﬃcial business HQ is in Chennai, but nothing conﬁrms whether their
trading servers are also located there or elsewhere.
Shoonya: Corporate oﬃces are in Mohali and Mumbai, but again, no
conﬁrmation on server locations or colocation infrastructure.
What You Can Do Next
If latency is a key concern for you, it's worth reaching out directly to their technical
support or business development teams and asking:
“Where are your API/trading servers (OMS, gateway) located?”
“Are they colocated in or near NSE’s Mumbai infrastructure (e.g., Mahape,
BKC)?”
“Can you provide average ping/latency stats from diﬀerent major cloud
providers or locations?”
This clariﬁcation will be invaluable for deciding whether to pursue low-latency
hosting near them—or whether your compute location matters less than you
thought.

any reply you get back!
