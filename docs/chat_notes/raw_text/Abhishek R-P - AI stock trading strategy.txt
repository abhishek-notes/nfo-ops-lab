Abhishek R-P - AI stock trading strategy
What's a quick way to use an AI to trade, make trades 
for example? What I'm thinking about is like just the 
top of my head it's like subscribing to RSS feed of 
something like Economics Times etc. in India. It's for 
Indian stock market and then whenever a positive 
news launches as soon as it drops for a particular stock 
or a particular industry I want to use my AI agent to 
invest a certain amount. that I am willing to risk on that 
particular way so give me a whole structure, 
architecture of this what are the best possible ways like 
this is a very new thought in my mind but I'm thinking 
to explore more on this but yeah you give me every 
information everything you have plan strategy what is 
important what is not important how it has worked in 
the past for other people what works what doesn't 
work who all people are employing these things etc. 
where the risks are for me where the proﬁt margins 
are for me how should I structure it that kind of deal 
you can think hard about this then give me a possible 
answer. 
Great idea—and totally doable—but the winning version is not “read ET RSS →  buy
quickly.” By the time a headline hits mainstream RSS, the move is usually gone. In
India, the earliest, tradable news is almost always the exchange corporate
announcement (NSE/BSE) or a machine-readable vendor feed; mainstream portals
are minutes late.
Below is a practical, low-BS blueprint you can actually build, plus what works, what
doesn’t, risks, and how others run this.
TL;DR: the winning shape
Signal source (fastest ﬁrst):
1. NSE/BSE corporate announcements (oﬃcial, timestamped) →  strongest
edge. 
1/7

2. Paid machine-readable feeds (Reuters/Bloomberg/TickerPlant/etc.). Free or
“cheap” APIs exist but are often delayed or EOD. 
3. Mainstream RSS/Twitter only as conﬁrmation or for slower thematic bets.
Classiﬁer before “AI”: small, deterministic event classiﬁer (buyback, order win,
rating change, capex, pledge release, results) + a light sentiment model. LLMs
are for summaries/explanations, not your trigger.
Execution: go through a regulated broker API (Zerodha Kite, Dhan, Angel,
Upstox). Start with discretionary order conﬁrm; later ﬂip to full auto after
approvals/logging are in place. 
Compliance (India, 2025): SEBI now requires tagged/approved algos via
brokers, provider registration, and auditability. Don’t skip this. 
What actually works (and why)
Works
Exchange announcements →  small/midcap drift. Things like “large order win,”
“buyback @ X,” “pledge release,” “rating upgrade,” “capacity expansion” often
produce tradeable 30–180 min moves in less-covered names. (Largecaps react
instantly; midcaps drift.)
Event rules > generic sentiment. If buyback price is 10% above CMP and size ≥
Y% of mcap →  high-conviction long. If order win value ≥  1× quarterly revenue →
positive drift. If pledge increase →  often negative short-term.
Human-in-the-loop in month 1–2. Let the system surface ranked, pre-sized
trades; you click “Send.”
Usually doesn’t
“ET RSS →  market”: big desks and prop shops have already read the exchange
PDF. You’ll chase.
Pure LLM trading: hallucinations, latency, and PDF tables confuse general
models. Use rules + tiny domain model; use LLM only to explain.
Architecture (battle-tested layout)
1) Ingestion (multi-source, prioritized)
2/7

NSE/BSE Corporate Announcements: scrape/poll the oﬃcial pages with backoﬀ,
or (better) subscribe to a vendor with minute-level or real-time beats. Map
ISIN ⇄ symbol. 
Tier-2: Reuters/DJ machine-readable news if budget allows.
Tier-3: Company X handles, broker blogs, ET/BS/Moneycontrol RSS →  conﬁrm
slower themes (sector momentum).
2) Normalization & entity linking
Clean the text/PDF; extract ﬁelds (company, instrument, numbers, units, dates,
rating agency, buyback price/size, order value, pledge %, etc.).
Link entity →  NSE/BSE symbol(s) via ISIN; fall back to fuzzy on name + sector.
3) Event classiﬁer (rules + micro-model)
Rule signatures (fast, robust):
Buyback: “buy-back/buyback”, “maximum price ₹X”, “aggregate amount ₹Y
crore”.
Order win: “received order/work order/LoA worth ₹X from …”.
Rating: “CRISIL/ICRA/CARE/India Ratings upgrades/downgrades”.
Pledge: “promoter pledge [increase/decrease]”.
Capex/expansion: “greenﬁeld/brownﬁeld”, capex ₹X.
Results: YoY/ QoQ deltas.
Sentiment/impact score: small ﬁn-tuned classiﬁer (distil-size) that outputs
impact ∈  [-1, +1] and conﬁdence. Keep it deterministic where money is at stake.
4) Strategy engine
Event →  playbook mapping, e.g.
Buyback above CMP & size big →  CNC buy + 1–3 day hold (or call spread on
liquid names).
Big order win vs revenue →  intraday to multi-day long with trailing stop.
Rating downgrade/pledge increase →  intraday short/futures if liquid,
otherwise avoid.
Position sizing: Kelly-lite (e.g., risk 0.25–0.5% of equity/trade), max sector
exposure caps, max 3 concurrent event bets.
5) Execution layer (broker APIs)
OMS microservice (FastAPI) that creates bracket/CO or GTT with pre-set SL/TP,
tags orders with algo ID, captures order/ack timestamps, and logs everything
for audit.
3/7

Start with “conﬁrm to execute” via Telegram/Slack; swap to fully automatic only
after your broker/exchange approvals. 
6) Storage, audit, and research
Event store (Postgres): announcement_id, time_seen, parsed ﬁelds, impact
score.
Market store (Parquet): 1-sec or tick bars for the symbol (you already have this).
Trade store: end-to-end latencies, slippage, P&L, reason codes
(“BUYBACK_>CMP10”).
Dashboards: win rate by event type, average drift, liquidity ﬁlters that work,
slippage by time-of-day.
7) Ops
Kill-switch, risk guardrails (max daily loss, per-trade loss, max exposure), and
circuit-breaker logic (e.g., disable after 3 consecutive fails).
Latency SLOs: ingest → parse → decide → order in ≤  2–5 s for equity; options are
tighter due to spreads.
Compliance & reality check (India, 2025)
SEBI/Exchange now requires tracking, tagging, and approvals for retail algos
oﬀered via brokers; brokers must obtain exchange permission for each strategy,
and orders must carry a unique identiﬁer. Design your stack for auditability
(full logs, replay, versioned strategy). 
SEBI is also proposing to bake algotrading oversight into the stock-broker
regulations; expect more process, not less. 
Bottom line: build it right (logs, versioning, order tags) and clear it with your
broker before ﬂipping to unattended auto.
MVP you could ship in ~1–2 weekends
1. Data
Poll NSE/BSE announcements (HTML/JSON endpoints) every 2–5 s with
ETag/backoﬀ; cache seen ids; save raw + parsed. 
(Optional) Add a paid corporate-announcement feed if budget allows
(strongly preferred for reliability). 
4/7

2. Parser + rules
Regex/keyword rules for buyback/order win/rating/pledge/capex/results;
compute impact features (e.g., buyback premium %, order_value/revenue,
rating notch).
3. Scorer
Light classiﬁer: logistic/GBM on impact features; add a tiny transformer only
to handle tricky language.
4. Strategy
Start with two high-edge plays: (A) Buybacks with large premium/size; (B)
Order wins ≥  1× quarterly revenue in small/midcaps.
Risk: 0.3%/trade, ﬁxed SL (ATR-based), time-based exit if no follow-through.
5. Execution
Zerodha Kite Connect or your preferred broker API. Place bracket/GTT with
tags; Telegram inline buttons: [Skip] [Half-Size] [Full]. 
6. Backtest
Rebuild an event study: for each historical announcement, align to your
market data at T₀ = time_seen + assumed latency (e.g., 5–30 s); compute
drift windows (5, 15, 60, 120 min; T+1 open).
Track slippage, borrow costs (if short), and realistic lot sizes.
7. Governance
Version every rule/model; store hashes in trade logs; nightly PDF of all day’s
trades/decisions for audit.
Edges, costs, and expectations
Edge: This is not HFT; you’re going for information-driven drift where the street
is slow to quantify impact (esp. midcaps). Expect lots of small wins and quick
scratches.
Costs: Feed + infra + API fees. Exchange-grade real-time announcement APIs can
run into lakhs/year; free scraping risks rate limits and downtime. 
Where margins live: clear, numeric events (buyback premium/size, order-value-
to-revenue, rating notch). Avoid vague PR lines.
Drawdowns: headline reversals, mis-parses, option spread blowouts, and “sell-
the-news” in crowded names.
5/7

Who uses this & how it’s evolved
Prop/HFT and big funds ingest machine-readable news and exchange PDFs in
milliseconds. For retail, the competitive spot is event drift on midcaps and well-
structured corporate actions.
India’s regulator has tightened oversight in 2024–2025 (algo tagging/approvals)
and is moving to formalize the framework. Plan for it from day one. 
Quick build kit (stack suggestion)
Ingestion: Python + httpx/Playwright; retry/backoﬀ; Redis stream for fan-out.
Parse/NER: spaCy/Presidio + your rules; pdftotext or camelot for tables.
Model: LightGBM/XGBoost on engineered features; optional mini-transformer
(distilbert-size) for conﬁdence.
Backtest: DuckDB/Polars over your Parquet ticks; event-aligned windows.
Execution: FastAPI OMS + Zerodha/Dhan SDK; persistent order router; Telegram
bot for conﬁrm. 
Observability: Prometheus + Grafana; alert on ingestion lag, parse failures,
broker rejects.
Governance: per-order algo_id, conﬁg hash, data provenance, immutable logs.
Next steps I’d take (practical)
1. Pick two event types (buyback, order win).
2. Build the announcement →  trade pipeline with manual conﬁrm.
3. Backtest on your 1-sec data with a +15 s latency assumption; size
conservatively.
4. Talk to your broker re: algo tagging/approval path; add audit logs now so you
don’t rework later. 
Want me to sketch the actual rule set + feature schema (CSV columns) and a minimal
FastAPI + broker-API scaﬀold you can paste into your repo? I can do that in one go.
